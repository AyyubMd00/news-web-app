            "Text: 13,000 Auto Workers Are Striking In US: Here Is All You Need To Know About This Historical Walkout Auto workers in the US Midwest have started a targeted strike against three big car manufacturers General Motors (GM), Ford, and Stellantis. The workers are demanding better pay and benefits, much of which they gave up at a time when firms were in financial trouble. At the stroke of midnight on Friday, the US auto workers' union United Auto Workers (UAW) started the precise strike strategy, causing simultaneous shutdowns at the \"Big Three\" automotive manufacturers in Detroit, Michigan for the very first time. According to an AFP report, about 13,000 workers walked off the job at a GM assembly plant in Wentzville, Missouri; a Ford factory in Wayne, Michigan, near Detroit; and a Stellantis Jeep plant in Toledo, Ohio. With honking and cheers union workers marched at a Ford plant in the Detroit area with UAW president Shawn Fain. \"Tonight, for the first time in our history, we will strike all three of the Big Three at once,\" said UAW President Shawn Fain. Let's take a look into why this happened and what kind of impact can this kind of a strike leave. Here Is How It Started The issue between the auto workers union UAW and three big carmakers is over a new contract. Every 4 years, the UAW negotiates a new master agreement on behalf of nearly 150,000 members working at General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis (formerly known as Chrysler), according to a Washington Post report. The old contract expired on September 14 and with no agreement, the UAW started the strikes. The WP report noted that under the traditional negotiation pattern of UAW, one of the three automakers is selected as the initial negotiation target, and the agreement reached with them serves as a template for the other two companies. This year's negotiations came as GM and Stellantis posted record profits, while Ford also enjoyed Healthy financial results. The auto workers want to get a part of these profits.Â  How Much Pay Raise Workers Are Deamding? As per the WP report, initially, the UAW requested a 40 per cent increase in compensation for their hourly workforce over the course of the four-year agreement, which equates to a 46 per cent rise when compounded. However, this was later reduced to 36 per cent. As of now, full-time UAW employees start at a wage of $18 per hour and reach a maximum of around $32 per hour. The union's goal is to narrow the gap between starting and top-tier pay rates. Additionally, in response to the sky-high inflation, the UAW seeks to reinstate a cost-of-living allowance (COLA) linked to inflation, a benefit that they gave up in 2007. They are also advocating for a reduction in the use of temporary workers and a faster path for these employees to attain full pay and benefits. The UAW is also demanding the restoration of other benefits that their members lost in the years leading up to the 2009 recession when GM and Chrysler filed for bankruptcy and received government bailouts. According to Fain, these concessions laid the groundwork for the companies to achieve record profits over the past decade. The demands from the union encompass the revival of traditional pensions and retiree Healthcare, along with a reduction in the workweek from 40 to 32 hours. Unionisation Of EV Workers The shift to electric vehicles (EVs), which require fewer components and less labor compared to gasoline-powered vehicles, is expected to result in the closure of plants producing engine parts for traditional cars. As consumers progressively embrace EVs, the US automakers are investing substantial sums in partnerships with Asian firms to construct battery manufacturing plants in the US, as batteries are a key component of EVs. As per the report, key areas of contention between the union and automakers involve the compensation and benefits of workers in these new facilities and whether the UAW can represent them. To date, only the Ultium plant in Ohio, jointly owned by GM and South Korea's LG Energy Solution, is unionised. The initial pay rate there was $15.50 per hour, but following a ratified agreement last month, wages have increased by $3 to $4 per hour, along with retroactive pay dating back to the union election in December, potentially resulting in significant sums for some workers. According to an Associated Press report, the UWA President has acknowledged that the union's demands are \"audacious.\" But he said that the richly profitable automakers can afford to raise workers' pay significantly to make up for what the union gave up to help the companies withstand the 2007-2009 financial crisis and the Great Recession. The report added that in the last ten years, the three major Detroit automakers have transformed into highly profitable entities, amassing a total net income of $164 billion, with $20 billion of that earned in the current year. The CEOs of these companies each receive multimillion-dollar annual compensation packages. What Car Makers Are Offering? Reports suggest the automakers have come closer to what UAW is demanding in terms of wages, but a big gap still remains. In an interview with CNN, GM CEO Mary Barra said that they are ready to offer a 20 per cent wage increase, including 10 per cent in the first year, over four years.Â  Ford is also offering 20 per cent pay increase, while Stellantis (formerly Fiat Chrysler) initially proposed 17.5 per cent but has since adjusted its offer. The car companies reject the union's demands, citing excessive costs. They argued that they're investing heavily in both traditional combustion-engine vehicles and electric vehicles, making higher labor costs unsustainable, reports added.Â  They also contend that a generous UAW contract would raise vehicle prices, potentially making Detroit automakers less competitive against European and Asian rivals. The AP report noted that analysts say, including wages and benefits, Detroit Three assembly plant workers receive around $60 per hour, compared to $40 to $45 per hour for workers at Asian automaker plants in the US. Also Read: SEBI Imposes Fine Worth Rs 2.46 Crore On Two Companies, Seven Individuals For Flouting Regulatory Norms The Targeted Strike And Way Forward Only a small part of the United Auto Workers, about 150,000 members initiated walkouts at select plants including a GM assembly plant in Wentzville, Missouri, a Ford factory in Wayne, Michigan, near Detroit, and a Stellantis Jeep plant in Toledo, Ohio. These strikes commenced at 11:59 PM Eastern time on Thursday. UAW President Shawn Fain said these targeted strikes are a means to gain leverage in contract negotiations and to keep the auto companies uncertain about the union's next moves. Additionally, this strategic action may prolong the union's $825 million strike fund. As per a report by AlJzeera, Fain said that, at present, the union does not intend to initiate a more extensive general strike. However, he made it clear that all possibilities remain open, should new contracts fail to be reached. The UAW might select additional plants for strikes in the coming days, depending on the progressâ€”or lack thereofâ€”at the bargaining table, the UAW president stated. \"If the companies continue to bargain in bad faith or continue to stall or continue to give us insulting offers, then our strike is going to continue to grow,\" Fain said, adding that the union \"will keep the companies guessing.\"Â  Amid this, US President Joe Biden has come out in support of the strikers saying he \"respects workers right to collective action.\" After negotiations broke down, the UAW announced a targeted strike at a few Big 3 auto plants.No one wants a strike, but I respect workers' right to collective action.Workers deserve to share in the benefits they helped create for an enterprise. pic.twitter.com/zlnvnYVvao â€” President Biden (@POTUS) September 15, 2023 How The Strike May Impact Car Prices And Economy According to the AP report, GM, Ford, and Stellantis have been running factories non-stop to build up inventory, but they only have a 70-day supply of vehicles. A strike could lead buyers to non-union competitors, worsening the shortage in an already chip-constrained market. A strike, particularly in the US Midwest, where most auto plants are located, could have significant economic repercussions. The auto industry contributes about 3 per cent to the US GDP, with Detroit automakers representing a major share of the US car market. Workers on strike would receive $500 a week in strike pay, far less than their regular wages, impacting the economy. The automakers would also suffer substantial financial losses, with a 10-day strike estimated to cost them nearly a billion dollars, based on calculations by the Anderson Economic Group, the report said. Notably, in 2019, a 40-day UAW strike cost GM alone $3.6 billion.\n",

The film sees him in an antagonist role. While promoting his film, Kashyap spoke about how he faced difficulties in his initial years in getting his films to cinema halls and how some of them were released on illegal websites.On the podcast Cyrus Says hosted by Cyrus Broacha, the host spoke about Kashyapâ€™s films which were not released in theatres and were released on piracy websites. Anurag agreed and said, â€œThatâ€™s the story of my life.â€ He also said that he only earned one-eighth of what he could have earned because his films were released illegally. He said, â€œPeople used to walk up to me and say, â€˜Aapki film dekhi (Saw your film)â€™ and I used to be like â€˜Lekin kahan dekhi (But where did you watch it)?â€™ I used to identify with porn in the sense that I was like porn; people watched my films secretly.â€He further said that people would watch his films and then question his â€œmorality and characterâ€. He said, â€œAt that time, the critics used to be like, â€˜What kind of a guy is this?â€™â€Meanwhile, Anurag Kashyap is currently seen in Haddi, which is now streaming on ZEE5.

For the unversed, the duo has now reunited on-screen in the film Haddi, marking Anurag's acting debut alongside Nawazuddin.In a conversation with Humans of Bombay, Anurag Kashyap expressed his comfort in working with Nawazuddin Siddiqui while saying that their creative synergy has always been seamless. However, what stood out in the interview was Anurag's poignant observation that Nawazuddin is often \"misjudged and misconstrued\" by the public.Anurag delved into the unique nature of Haddi, a film that allowed him to step into a world crafted by director Akshat Ajay Sharma, unlike anything he has encountered before. Anurag revealed that he portrays a character with negative shades in the movie, while Nawazuddin takes on the challenging role of a transgender character.When discussing Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Anurag Kashyap remarked, \"He's also an extremely misjudged and misconstrued person. Also because of whatever it is... the world sees you for many things. He is a guy who doesn't defend himself, he always stays silent. He never... he rarely stands up to something, out of love or whatever reasons it is or out of awkwardness. But when he does, it really makes a difference, but most often than not, he does not. But I know him really well inside out, so I have a very special place for him in my heart.\"Anurag went on to express his enduring admiration for Nawazuddin, highlighting the actor's unique qualities that set him apart in the industry. He added, \"It's always great working with him,\" and jokingly mentioned how Nawaz has managed to \"kick his a**\" during their collaboration in Haddi.In recent times, Nawazuddin Siddiqui's personal life, including his ongoing divorce from his wife Aaliyah, has garnered significant media attention.

In this way, the actor has broken his own opening day record of Rs. 57 crores, which he achieved earlier this year with Pathaan. In an exclusive chat with Bollywood Hungama, veteran trade analyst Taran Adarsh spoke about what this means to the industry.He said, â€œWhat an opening! Itâ€™s Rs. 65.50 crores, which is 19% higher than Pathaan, which was the highest ever at Rs. 57 crores. Just imagine if it was a holiday. So the potential of the film is Rs. 70-75 crores on any single day. Of course, it was a part holiday but its Shah Rukh Khanâ€¦ Everyone said that itâ€™s his comeback with Pathaan. And with Jawan he is saying, â€˜I am not going to go back.â€™â€Some time back, Taran Adarsh had predicted such an opening for Jawan. Recalling that, he said, â€œI was very confident not because of my prediction or whatever; I donâ€™t want to give myself any credit for that. I would say only one person (made it possible) â€“ Shah Rukh Khan himself. I feel whatever collection you are witnessing, itâ€™s because of this force called Shah Rukh Khan. As I have always said, he is number one to number five. We canâ€™t even give rankings to him. He has reached that stage.â€He added, â€œI would like to tell you that he has brought so much happiness to the industry in terms of box office numbers. Pathaan and Jawan have had such fantabulous starts at the box office. Itâ€™s a whole circle in the film industry, which benefits from a good opening.â€Generally, in a masala film, one is advised to keep logic at home. However, Adarsh feels that one shouldnâ€™t do this with Jawan because itâ€™s much more than just a massy entertainer. â€œHere we need to advise people to take their brains with them because the film has a lot of messages from start to end,â€ he added.Directed by Atlee Kumar and produced by SRKâ€™s Red Chillies Entertainment, Jawan also stars Nayanthara, Vijay Sethupathi, Sanya Malhotra, Priya Mani, among others.Also Read: Jawan Overseas Box Office: Shah Rukh Khan starrer is unstoppable in key international markets\n",

            "Text: EXCLUSIVE: Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s body double Prashant Walde shares FASCINATING trivia about how Jawan was shot: â€œThe blast that took place in the scene in the government hospital was quite risky. In 18 seconds, 28 blasts were carried outâ€ Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Jawan is doing record Business. A lot of people contributed big time to the film, apart from its leading actors, directors etc. One of them is Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s body double Prashant Walde. He spoke exclusively to Bollywood Hungama about his experience of working on the film and a lot more.Prashant Walde began by talking about having a bald look. He said, â€œFor the first time, I did such prosthetic make-up in my life. We shot for almost a month in this look. I used to get boils as chemicals are used in prosthetic make-up. My skin used to get burnt. If the prosthetics were applied on alternate days, then it would not be a problem.â€He said his family members were amused by his bald look, â€œUnko dekh ke maza aata tha. Itâ€™s a work that requires the utmost attention. Agar theek se nahin kiya, toh fatt jaata tha. It takes 2-3 hours. There were times when Shah Rukh bhai used to look at my prosthetics and remark, â€˜Tera toh bada accha laga hua haiâ€™! Toh bada taam jaam rehta tha set pe!â€Prashant continued, â€œThere was a lot of detailing. They made sure that the shade of the bandage didn't change. Even for the old look, a lot of care was taken. Atlee sir used to keep an eye on these details.â€Â  View this post on Instagram Â  A post shared by Prashant Walde (@prashantwalde) He went on praising the blockbuster director, â€œAtlee sir worked with a lot of dedication and we can see today how it has worked big time. And of course, Shah Rukh bhai also gave his life and soul to the film. He had to face several problems during the course of the shoot. In our hearts, we knew that yeh film dhamaal karne waali hai! And thatâ€™s what happened. Until now, Bollywood had never seen a film like this. Everyone is unanimously saying that this is Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s best film!â€Prashant Walde added, â€œEven when we shot for the first teaser, I got a feeling from inside that Jawan will create history. I told this even to Shah Rukh bhaiâ€™s team. They used to tell me, â€˜Prashant, chup reh. Nazar mat lagaâ€™ (laughs)!â€Explaining why he felt so, he explained, â€œI have done many films and ads in 17 years. But the experience and vibe of Jawan were something else. Atlee sirâ€™s shift used to be for 12 hours but we would end up working for 14 hours. I don't remember the shoot getting over in 12 hours ever! We used to be tired and yet, we couldnâ€™t wait to report to the set the next day. Atlee sir would tell me, 'Tum monitor pe baithe raho. Kabhi bhi zarurat pad sakti hai'. I had no qualms as I had never seen such direction before. His whole team was also quite dedicated. In Bollywood, jo humein diya gaya hai, log wohi kaam karte hai in terms of the breakdown of scenes. But Atlee sir and his team used to always wonder how they could make the scene better. Everyone on the set was always running as if theyâ€™ll miss the train if they slow down!â€He further stated, â€œAtlee sir ko jo chahiye, agar unhe us cheez ko Shah Rukh bhai nahin dete the, toh Atlee sir khud karke dikhate the. And Shah Rukh bhai would surrender. He ensured he delivered as per Atlee sir's requirement. Both would never compromise. The dedication of Atlee sir and hard work of Shah Rukh bhai...you had to see it to believe it.â€Prashant Walde also revealed that Atlee was a stickler for punctuality, â€œOnce, there was a major traffic jam around Kalina University due to Maharashtraâ€™s former Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray's visit. I got stuck. Our call time was at 6:00 pm. Suddenly, I saw Atlee sir speedily walking towards the shoot venue. I called him and asked him to join me in the car. But he politely declined, saying that he was late. He walked a great distance since he realised he'd reach faster on foot.â€Â  View this post on Instagram Â  A post shared by Prashant Walde (@prashantwalde) At Kalina University, the scene of the hospital in the first half was shot. Prashant Walde revealed, â€œThe blast that took place in the scene in the government hospital was quite risky. In 18 seconds, 28 blasts were carried out. We all were told to stay as far away as possible due to the risk. But I said, 'Mujhe toh dekhna hai'! And it was quite a sight. Aise khatarnaak blasts hue the! There were so many camera setups and other preparations that they had to do it in one take. And they managed to do so.â€Prashant Walde then mentioned about the climax scene, comprising Azad and Vikram Rathore, both of which were played by Shah Rukh Khan. He said, â€œSometimes, Shah Rukh bhai used to shoot for the young character, that is, Azadâ€™s portions. At times, he used to play Vikram Rathore. If heâ€™s playing Vikram, I would be performing the role of Azad and vice versa.â€Prashant then praised Vijay Sethupathi, â€œVijay Sethupathi ji would deliver dialogues in Tamil. He would then memorize dialogues in Hindi and deliver the lines. However, at times, the energy or feel would be less than what it was when he said the lines in Tamil. He used to ask Shah Rukh bhai constantly, â€˜Is this okay? Better?â€™. Shah Rukh bhai would reply, â€˜Yes, better than the previous shotâ€™. This would lead to a lot of retakes.â€He continued, â€œThe scene where heâ€™s about to shoot Vikram Rathore just before the latter gets his memory, everyone on the set, comprising 1000-1500 people, clapped after Vijay Sethupathi ji delivered the lines in Hindi. His secretary was well-versed in the language. She used to categorically tell him if the Hindi dialogues werenâ€™t delivered properly by him. Though he had got claps, he still went for a retake (after she gave her feedback). In the previous take, he had given 40% energy. In the next take, he gave more than 100% energy. Shah Rukh then felt that even he should perform energetically. Atlee sir, however, told him that itâ€™s not needed as per the scene and his Azad character. Atlee sir also told me to stand in one shot opposite Vijay Sethupathi ji. It was a lot of fun.â€Finally, Prashant Walde is content that Jawan has worked big time, â€œWe are a very small part of the film. But I am happy to see that Jawan is so well received. Itni mehnat karne ke baad upar waale ne fal de diya! Also with Gadar 2 and many other films also doing well, the industry will benefit immensely. So many people will get work.â€As for what next, he replied, â€œAfter Pathaan and Jawan, I am sure Shah Rukh bhaiâ€™s next Dunki will also be a blockbuster!â€Â  View this post on Instagram Â  A post shared by Prashant Walde (@prashantwalde) Also Read: Shah Rukh Khan responds to Anand Mahindra after he calls Jawan star a â€œnatural resourceâ€: â€œI keep trying in my small humble way to make our country proud in terms of making cinemaâ€\n",

Citrus fruits' high vitamin C content aids in reversing this process, leaving your skin glowing and young-looking. When it comes to your hair, vitamin C helps with the synthesis of collagen and keratin, two things required for Healthy, strong hair. Additionally, it facilitates the uptake of iron from plant-based sources, ensuring that your hair follicles get the minerals they need for Healthy growth.

            "Text: Fossil Fuel Treaty Necessary For 'Just And Socially Equitable' Clean Energy Transition: Experts On How To Achieve Net Zero By 2050 Net Zero By 2050: In the G20 New Delhi Leaders' Declaration signed on September 9, 2023, world leaders have pledged to achieve global net zero greenhouse gas emissions, or carbon neutrality, by mid-century, which is 2050. As part of the Green Development Pact for a Sustainable Future, the leaders have promised to achieve carbon neutrality while keeping in mind the latest scientific developments and national circumstances. They also intend to adopt approaches such as a circular carbon economy.Â  The declaration has also emphasised the importance of a policy for sustainable and climate finance that consists of fiscal, market and regulatory mechanisms, and also carbon pricing. Together, these mechanisms can help the world become carbon neutral or achieve a net zero economy. Carbon pricing places a fee on emitting greenhouse gases, and offers an incentive for emitting less, in order to curb greenhouse gas emissions.Â  In order to reach net zero emissions by 2050, there is a need for US $5.8 to $5.9 trillion before 2030 for developing countries. This amount will help the countries implement their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which are climate action plans signed by all the Parties to the Paris Agreement to cut emissions and adapt to climate impacts. In order to ensure there are sufficient clean energy technologies by 2030 to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, US $4 trillion per year will be required.Â  MUST READ | G20 Summit 2023: How The Green Development Pact Promises To Address Climate Change Challenges The need for a Fossil Fuel Treaty to achieve a â€œjustâ€ clean energy transition Wealthy nations have more resources than vulnerable and developing countries, and hence, it is their responsibility to implement measures and take action to achieve global net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Rich countries must achieve this target \"more quickly\" than other nations, Harjeet Singh, Head of Global Political Strategy, Climate Action Network International (CAN-I), a global network in over 130 countries working to combat the climate crisis, told ABP Live. He explained that achieving \"global net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 is an urgent necessity to avert climate catastrophe\".Â  Singh also proposed the idea of a new global mechanism â€” a Fossil Fuel Treaty. He said that this framework will support developing countries in transitioning away from fossil fuel dependency. â€œSuccess requires coordinated action from all sectors of society: governments, Businesses, communities, and individuals alike. While we reinforce existing agreements like the Paris Accord with stricter emissions targets, we must also introduce a new global mechanism â€” a Fossil Fuel Treaty. This framework should support developing countries as they transition away from dependency on fossil fuels for energy, revenue, and employment, without undermining their economic stability. At the same time, it should compel richer nations to enact bold, domestic changes. Now is the time for a comprehensive, international strategy that ensures a just transition away from fossil fuels for all.â€ Explaining that a Fossil Fuel Treaty is necessary for a just and socially equitable clean energy transition, Singh said that strong regulatory frameworks, financial incentives, and support from the international community will act as catalysts in the world's journey towards achieving net zero. MUST READ | The Science Of Health: Projected Incidence Of Lung Cancer In India By Decade End, And Gene Therapies To Cure It Materials transition is key to achieving a net-zero future The G20 nations are trying to balance investment in clean infrastructure with economic priorities, and offset the loss of fossil fuel jobs with green jobs. Materials transition, which refers to the process of designing better materials to build products such that emissions are reduced not only during manufacturing, but also while using, disposing or reusing the products, is key to achieving a net-zero future. â€œThe materials transition is not facing ESG (Environment, Social, Governance) bottlenecks, but rather Employment, Finances, and Greed, or 'EFG' bottlenecks that need to be addressed if the G20 nations are going to resolve conflicts,â€ said Rajat Verma, Founder & CEO of LOHUM, a lithium-ion battery recycling company.Â  MUST READ |Â Science For Everyone: What Are UFOs? Know Interesting Anecdotes, And How NASA Aims To Track Them How battery regulation laws will ensure a sustainable future Verma explained that achieving net zero by mid-century will be possible if the G20 facilitates low-cost producers that can reliably supply secondary raw materials. There must be a skilled green workforce, environmentally-conscious products must be used, and a regulatory framework to help low-cost producers thrive must be established, he suggested.Â  \"Some of the key policy developments introduced by the G20 Nations to accelerate net zero objectives include the European Battery Regulation 2023 and India's Battery Waste Management Rules 2022. These policies provide a comprehensive regulatory foundation for sustainable, circular, and carbon neutral ecosystems,\" said Verma. MUST READ |Â Secured Sharing Of Climate Data, Better Drug Traceability â€” What Blockchain, Web3 Can Do For Climate Science, Healthcare Europe's Battery Regulation Law will ensure that batteries built in Europe are collected, reused and recycled, have a low carbon footprint, and use minimal harmful substances in order to support a transition to a circular economy, enhance the strategic autonomy of the European Union, and increase the security of raw materials supply and energy. India's Battery Waste Management Rules 2022 is based on the concept of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), where the producers and importers of batteries are responsible for the collection and recycling of waste batteries, and the use of recovered materials from wastes into new batteries. EPR also prohibits the disposal of waste batteries in landfills and incineration.Â  The rules were published on August 24, 2022, by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.Â  A circular economy is a model of production and consumption in which the life cycle of products is increased, and waste is reduced to a minimum through the sharing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing, and recycling of existing materials as long as possible. MUST READ | Global Group Signs Open Letter Calling For World Leaders To Agree At COP28 To Triple Renewable Energy Capacity By 2030 The role of carbon pricing in the journey towards a net-zero future Another mechanism that will play a crucial role in helping the world achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 is carbon pricing.Â  This is because by assigning a cost to each ton of emitted carbon dioxide, carbon pricing sends a powerful market signal that incentivises Businesses and encourages them to adopt greener alternatives, said Singh. â€œWhile mechanisms like a carbon tax or cap-and-trade can make polluting expensive and drive innovation in clean technologies, these alone cannot replace the need for regulating and penalising polluting corporations.â€ Singh explained that the focus must be on reducing emissions effectively while also generating revenue for reinvestment in sustainable infrastructure and social programs. He also emphasised the importance of supporting small and medium enterprises in this journey. â€œAs we face the urgency of climate change, carbon pricing, coupled with regulation of large companies and support for small and medium enterprises, can galvanise wide-ranging actions across sectors,â€ said Singh. If the carbon price is high, emitters will be encouraged to collaborate with organisations that have an inclination towards cleaner and low-carbon emitting technologies. As a result, more organisations will start performing emission reduction activities.Â  Verma said that a point may be reached where emitters will find it more economical to explore alternate, less carbon-intensive technologies for their Businesses. Such a system can succeed if there are clear regulations. He also said that the Energy Conservation (Amendment) Bill 2022, and the green credit system are some crucial steps taken towards achieving net zero.Â  The Energy Conservation (Amendment) Bill amends the Energy Conservation Act, 2001, to allow the Centre to specify a carbon credit trading scheme, and mandates some designated consumers to meet a fraction of their energy needs from non-fossil fuel sources. All this will help reduce carbon emissions, and hence, mitigate climate change.\n",

According to several reports, the joint infrastructure deal could be announced during the G20 summit in New Delhi, to be held on September 9-10.Â  According to an Axios report on Thursday, the project is one of the key initiatives US President Biden is pushing in the Middle East to counter China's influence in the region. Notably, the Middle East is a key part of China's Belt and Road vision. Reports citing US officials involved in talks said that the project will connect Arab countries in the Levant and the Gulf via a network of railways that will also connect to India through seaports in the Gulf. However, the work on the announcement is still ongoing and it is not final yet. It noted that if the four countries complete the negotiations in the next two days, their leaders will sign a MoU outlining the parameters of the project.Â  According to a Reuters report, the project could reduce shipping times, cost, and the use of diesel and make trade faster and cheaper. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden are set to meet on Friday evening. According to the news agency, Biden could also meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Â  What Is The Project-How It Came To Light According to the Axios report, the project first came up during the I2U2 (India, Israel, UAE, and USA ) forum meeting. During the I2U2 meetings held over the past year, Israel introduced a proposal for establishing railway connections in the region, as per sources. This proposal also incorporated India's extensive experience in managing large-scale infrastructure projects. Subsequently, the Biden administration further developed this concept by suggesting the involvement of Saudi Arabia. In May, Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, during his trip to Saudi Arabia met with counterparts from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and India. During this meeting, the railway project was the central topic of discussion. Subsequently, meetings led by Biden's senior adviser for energy and infrastructure, Amos Hochstein, further developed the project.Â  According to a report by the Associated Press, the project would involve ship transit between India and Saudi Arabia, then trains through Saudi Arabia and the UAE, likely to Jordan, and then ship transit to Turkey and onward from there by train,Â  Saudi Normalising Ties With IsraelÂ  According to reports, if Saudi Arabia and Israel normalise their ties, the Jewish country could also be part of the project. According to AP, then the trains from Jordan could cross into Israel at Beit Sheâ€™an and arrive at the Haifa port. The news agency noted that Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had earlier talked about the possibility of a train linking Israel to Saudi Arabia. The Axios report said, via this project, the US government is seeking to complete its diplomatic push for a mega-deal with Saudi Arabia that could include normalisation of ties between the gulf nation and Israel.Â \n",

            "Text: G20: World Bank Lauds India's Transformative Impact Of Digital Public Infra The World Bank has praised India's transformative impact of Digital Public Infrastructures (DPIs) in the past decade under the Narendra Modi-led government. As part of the G20 Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion the World Bank prepared a document and highlighted the steps taken by the Centre and the pivotal role of government policy and regulation in shaping the DPI landscape. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday tweeted about the World Bankâ€™s G20 document where the global agency lauded Indiaâ€™s leap in financial inclusion. India's leap in financial inclusion, powered by Digital Public Infrastructure! A G20 document prepared by the @WorldBank shared a very interest point on India's growth. India has achieved financial inclusion targets in just 6 years which would otherwise have taken at least 47â€¦ â€” Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) September 8, 2023 The report stated about Indiaâ€™s standout achievements and rapid progress in financial inclusion. The Jan Dhan Yojana (JAM) Trinity, comprising the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), Aadhaar, and mobile numbers, has played a pivotal role in increasing financial inclusion rates. In six years, India has catapulted its financial inclusion rate from 25 per cent in 2008 to over 80 per cent of adults, the report mentioned. World Bank paper has also lauded the lower cost of compliance for banks for KYC. This monumental leap shortened the journey towards financial inclusion by up to 47 years, a feat primarily attributed to the influence of DPIs, according to World Bank. â€œWhile DPIsâ€™ role in this leapfrogging is undoubtable, other ecosystem variables and policies that build on the availability of DPIs were critical. These included interventions to create a more enabling legal and regulatory framework, national policies to expand account ownership, and leveraging Aadhaar for identity verification,â€ the document states. India's DPI has not only transformed the public sector but has also enhanced efficiency for private organisations. Some Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) reported an 8 per cent higher conversion rate in SME lending, a 65 per cent reduction in depreciation costs, and a 66 per cent decrease in costs related to fraud detection. The document mentioned the phenomenal success of India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI) with over 9.41 billion transactions valued at about Rs 14.89 trillion taking place in May 2023 alone. For the fiscal year 2022â€“23, the total value of UPI transactions nearly reached 50 per cent of India's nominal GDP. The UPI-PayNow interlinking between India and Singapore, operationalised in February 2023, has facilitated faster, cheaper, and more transparent cross-border payments in line with the G20's financial inclusion priorities.\n",

            "Text: Government Increases Windfall Tax On Domestic Crude, Reduces Duty On Diesel, ATF Exports The government announced a hike in special additional excise duty (SAED) on crude petroleum on Friday. This hike takes the duty on crude petroleum to Rs 10,000 per tonne and will come into effect from September 16, the official release from the finance ministry noted.Â  The government also reduced the SAED or duty on the export of diesel from the current rate of Rs 6 per litre to Rs 5.50 per litre. Additionally, duty on jet fuel or ATF has also been reduced to Rs 3.5 per litre from Rs 4 per litre. However, the SAED on petrol will continue to be nil, reported PTI. This decision will increase the windfall tax on domestically produced crude oil which was set at Rs 6,700 per tonne. Crude oil prices have been on the rise for the past three weeks and the Brent crude benchmark crossed the $94 per barrel mark on Friday. This development will impact oil exploration companies. The government hiked special additional excise duty (SAED) on crude petroleum to Rs 10,000 per tonne from today. The windfall tax on domestically produced crude oil was set at Rs 6,700/tonne. The duty on jet fuel or ATF will be reduced to Rs 3.5/litre from Rs 4/litre currently.â€¦ pic.twitter.com/OnzTAlQLK8 â€” ANI (@ANI) September 16, 2023 Notably, India started imposing windfall profit taxes on July 1 last year joining countries levying taxes on abnormal profits of oil-producing companies. The tax rates are reviewed every two weeks on the basis of average oil prices in the previous two weeks. The government imposes tax on windfall profits of oil producers once they get a price above the ceiling of $75 per barrel. The tax on fuel exports is decided on the basis of margins earned by refiners on overseas shipments. These margins reflect the difference between the international oil price realised and the cost.Â  The government has managed to collect nearly Rs 40,000 crore in SAED imposed on crude oil production and petroleum products exports since July last year. A windfall tax represents a higher tax imposed by the government on certain industries when they report above-average and unexpected profits.Â  The government announced a cut in the windfall tax earlier this year in May when it reduced the tax on crude petroleum to zero.Â  Also Read : Brent Crude Trading Above $94/Barrel Mark Amid Output Cuts, Experts See More Price Rise\n",

            "Text: I.N.D.I.A. 4, NDA 3: Five Key Takeaways from Bypoll Results In Six States Ahead Of 2024 Bypoll Results: The recent bypolls held for seven seats in six states have thrown up mixed results, which were declared on September 8. These were the first elections since the formation of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (I.N.D.I.A.) by Opposition parties and a rebranded National Development Alliance (NDA) was created by the BJP. TheÂ I.N.D.I.A. bloc won four seats while the NDA won three, with no change in the overall tally. However, the results show some interesting trends and send out key messages ahead of the general elections to be held in 2024.Â  Of the total seven seats, five were retained by the incumbent party. Among the other two seats, the BJP wrested Boxanagar (Tripura) from the CPM, but lost the Dhupguri seat in West Bengal to the ruling TMC. 5 Key Takeaways From The Bypoll Verdict 1. Tripura: BJP Gets 1st Muslim MLA, Little Of Left RemainsÂ  In Boxanagar seat of Tripura, the CPM and the BJP were locked in a direct contest after the death of the Left MLA, Samsul Haque in July this year. The BJP achieved a significant milestone in Tripura's political landscape as the party got its first MLA from the Muslim community. Party candidate Tafajjal Hossain won the seat by over 30,000 votes. He had lost the seat by a whisker, less than 5,000 votes, six months ago.Â  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been emphasising to the BJP cadre the need to make an outreach to the marginalised sections of society. The results show slow and steady progress made by these efforts. Also, the results further weaken the Left Front in Tripura, once its bastion. The CPM is now a major force only in Kerala.Â  2. West Bengal: Dhupguri Result May Redraw State Alliances Ahead Of 2024 In Dhupguri, which fell vacant after the death of BJP's Bishnupada Roy, the TMC, the BJP and the CPM locked horns, with the Congress backing the CPM candidate. So two parties from the I.N.D.I.A. bloc contested this seat. Contrary to popular perception that unity of all the three forces (TMC, Congress, Left) is a must to defeat the BJP in the state, the results show that the TMC benefitted from a triangular contest. The TMC won the seat by 4,300 votes, with the CPM polling more than 13,000 votes, holding onto its strength. The decades old CPM-TMC rivalry means the CPM along with the BJP gets a portion of the anti-TMC or anti-Mamata Banerjee votes. The Left also gets some minority community votes, which would otherwise go to the TMC if it doesnâ€™t contest.Â  However, if all three join hands, the TMC may stand to lose more than it gains as all the anti-TMC vote would then get consolidated in favour of the BJP. Polarisation always helps the BJP, research has shown. So we could see friendly fights in Bengal from the I.N.D.I.A. bloc.Â  3. UP: BSP Has A Message For I.N.D.I.A.Â  In the most high-pitch battle among the seven bypolls, the SP managed to retain the seat vacated by the ghar-wapsi of Dara Singh Chauhan to the BJP. Dara Singh Chauhanâ€™s re-entry along with OP Rajbharâ€™s return to the NDA fold was expected to give a boost to the BJPâ€™s prospects in Purvanchal where the party suffered losses in 2019 Lok Sabha elections and 2022 state polls.Â  Chauhan, a BJP heavyweight and former OBC Morcha president, had left the BJP ahead of the 2022 state elections. After the BJPâ€™s comeback at state level, he re-joined the party hoping to get back in power. He has been a big party hopper all his life, moving from the Congress to the SP to the BSP to the BJP to the SP to the BJP again, and voters seem to have shown mirror to these breed of politicians.Â  The BSP did not contest, the party has 20-35% vote share in this seat over the elections since 2002. The seat has a good number of minority and Dalit population (40%-45%). BSP had put up a minority candidate in 2022, and his votes seem to have got transferred to the SP candidate largely. Mayawati seems to have a covert message for the I.N.D.I.A. block â€” that it can gain strength if the BSP is included. A bipolar contest in 2024 could go either way. She could still join the bloc if a good bargain is given to her, else could split the opposition/anti-BJP vote in 2024. UP's Ghosi was the only seat in this round of bypolls where it was a direct NDA vs I.N.D.I.A. contest.Â  4. Sympathy Factor Still Works, MostlyÂ  Five of the bypolls â€” Dhupguri, Puthuppally, Bageshwar, Dumri and Boxanagar â€” were necessitated due to the death of the sitting MLAs. In Ghosi and Dhanpur, their MLAs' resignation led to fresh polls. Samajwadi Party's Dara Singh Chauhan had resigned as MLA in Ghoshi and re-joined the BJP. In Dhanpur, BJP's Pratima Bhoumik had resigned to retain her Lok Sabha seat, which left the assembly seat vacant.Â  Generally, in bypolls necessitated by death, the deceasedâ€™s party enjoys sympathy and the seat is retained by the party. Of the five seats, this trend was maintained in three seats as the incumbent party put up family members of the deceased as their candidate. 5. Trend Of Ruling Party Having An Advantage In Bypolls Holds GoodÂ  It has been a trend that party in power generally wins in such bypolls because of the administrative control. Also, since these seat elections have no bearing on the power situation in the states, these tend to get very hyperlocal. In five of the seven seats, this trend was maintained. Only in Kerala and UP, the seats were won by opposition parties â€” the Congress and the SP, respectively. To sum up, the state election results may not have a significant impact on the Lok Sabha elections to be held next year, as the context and character of polls are different. However, since these polls were held very close to the general elections, the underlying themes cannot be ignored altogether.\n",

Company shareholders aren't given loans and instead are putting equity in the firm, he added, asking the Union Ministry of Finance to look into this.Replying to him, the Income Tax Department in a post on X said, \"Section 68 of Income-tax Act, 1961 (the Act) under which the Assessing Officer (AO) has made the enquiry about creditworthiness of the shareholder/investor, places initial onus on the assessee-company to prove the following: a) Identity of the investor, b) Creditworthiness of the investor and c) Genuineness of the transaction.\" It went on to state that the \"Finance Act, 2012 mandated that the nature and source of any sum credited as share capital, share premium etc., in the books of a closely-held company (excluding Venture Capital Fund or a Venture Capital Company registered with SEBI) shall be treated as explained u/s 68 only if the source of funds from a resident shareholder is also explained by investor.\"On the cases raised by Grover, it said: \"In the present case, it appears that the AO has sought to examine the genuineness of the transaction and source of investment by the shareholder-investor, to verify if the amount invested is commensurate with the income shown in the ITRs of the investors.\" Alternatively, it sought income tax permanent account numbers or PAN of the investors be shared so that the income tax returns of the investors can be verified.\"This has been the practice,\" it added.Infosys co-founder and investor Mohandas Pai jumped in to say that this was \"misleading\".He first tagged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Prime Minister's Office (PMO) on Grover's initial post to say, \"sir tax terrorism is increasing! This is against what you have stood for. Please intervene.\" That post he tagged a host of politicians and ministers including BJP Yuva Morcha national president and MP Tejasvi Surya and BJP's Bengaluru Central MP P C Mohan.After, Income Tax Department clarified the position clearing stating that the alternative to furnishing three years of income tax return is to furnish PAN of the investors, he posted again.\"Again this is misleading,\" he said, tagging the Union Ministry of Finance, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. \"Asking for the PAN is the law. But how can you also ask for 3 year tax returns of the investor from the start up? Does the law permit this. @IncomeTaxIndia itself says that Pan is sufficient. Why this overreach?,\" he asked.Grover reposted Pai's post on X.\n",

In what was the final match of the Super Four stage of the continental tournament, the result of which had no impact on the final lineup with both Sri Lanka and India having sealed a place in the summit clash, India decided to bowl first. After being reduced to 59/4, a partnership between Shakib Al Hasan (80 off 85) and Towhid Hridoy (54 off 81) helped them revive their innings as they eventually posted 265/8.In response, India lost early wickets but Shubman Gill held his end up and responded with a fine century (121). However, Bangladesh continued to take wickets and eventually find a way to get past Gill with the required run rate mounting. Axar Patel showed some fight with the bat scoring 42 off 34 but got out in the penultimate over of the match. With 12 needed of 6 balls, Mohammed Shami did manage to find a boundary but got run out in an attempt to get back on strike for the final ball, ending India's innings at 259.Shakib was adjudged the Player of the match for his all-round contribution as he scalped 1 for 43 after his invaulable contribution with the bat. Debutant Tanzim Hasan Sakib also had a game to remember as he sent back Rohit Sharma for a two-ball duck before also picking the wicket of Tilak Varma. He returned to defend 12 off the last over although it helped that India had just one wicket remaining. The result means India's unbeaten run in the continental tournament ends before they play the final at the same venue on Sunday (September 17). Bangladesh, meanwhile, managed to end their campaign on a high registering their solitary win of the Super 12 stage after succumbing to a defeat against Pakistan and Sri Lanka earlier.\n",

The other big news is that no overs will be reduced and it remains a 50-overs per side contest. Having said that, the weathe report in Colombo for the reserve day doens't look too promising either with chances of rain even on Monday (September 11) and so it would be interesting to see what eventually happens in this match.For the unversed, this is the second time an India vs Pakistan match was played in this continental tournament after their group-stage face off at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium in Kandy. However, even in that match rain had played a spoilsport and teams were ultimately forced to share points with only the Indian innings possible as they posted 266 after electing to bat first. There was no reserve day in place for that match.Teams would well be forced to share points in case rain comes back tomorrow. Pakistan have already started off their Super Fours campaign with a win over Bangladesh while this is India's first match in this round of the continental tournament. This match seeping into Reserve Day also means India will now have two matches in two days with India's match against Sri Lanka scheduled on September 12.\n",

While Pakistan won the toss and elected to field first, Indian openers got the team off to a splendid start with each of Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill scoring half-centuries.Rohit eventually departed for 56 off 49 balls, falling to Shadab Khan in the 17th over and bringing an end to a 121-run partnership. In the very next over, Shaheen Shah Afridi removed Gill with a slower delivery. That brought two new batters at the middle Virat Kohli and comeback man KL Rahul who replaced Shreyas Iyer in the Playing 11. The two were looking to get set before eyeing a strong finish as rain came in and covers had to be brought on with India's scoreboard reading 147/2 in 24.1 overs.However, a visual has since then been the talk of the cricketing world. Pakistan opener Fakhar Zaman was spotted helping the ground staff in bringing the covers on to the field.

He achieved the feat during India's Asia Cup 2023, Super Fours encounter against Pakistan, at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Monday (September 11). The right-handed batter reached to the milestone in his 278th ODI in what happens to be his 267th innings in this format. While the match was scheduled to take place on September 10, the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) kept a reserve day in provision for this match and as it turned out, the match did seep into the reserve day with rain making only 24.1 overs of play possible on the first day. Talking about India's innings, it was a sensational batting performance from them with each of their top four batters scoring at least a half-century. While Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill scored half-centuries, Kohli and KL Rahul smashed hundreds.Also on ABP LIVE: IND vs PAK, Asia Cup 2023 Super Fours- LIVE UPDATES It was a night where Kohli broke several records.

            "Text: India-Canada Row: Experts Say Diplomatic Tensions Unlikely To Impact Trade Ties The diplomatic tensions are unlikely to impact trade relations between India and Canada, as economic ties are driven by commercial considerations, experts said. The current flare-up in geopolitical relationships began as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused the Indian government of having possible links with the killing of a Khalistani separatist leader in June.Â  The North American country asked an Indian official to leave that country. In retaliation, India also expelled one of the Canadian diplomats.Â  Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) Co-Founder Ajay Srivastava told news agency PTI that recent events are unlikely to affect the deep-rooted people-to-people connections, trade, and economic ties between the two nations. Both countries, according to Srivastava, don't compete on similar product sections.Â  \"Hence, the trade relationship will continue to grow and not be affected by day-to-day events,\" Srivastava said. According to Sharad Kumar Saraf, Chairman of Mumbai-based Technocraft Industries, \"The bilateral trade is entirely driven by commercial considerations. Political turmoil is of a temporary nature and should not be a reason to affect trade relations.\"Â  However, he noted that the current frosty relations are certainly a cause for concern. \"In fact, bilateral trade is an effective tool to improve political relations. India must make special efforts to increase our bilateral trade with Canada,\" Saraf said. Notably, India and Canada put a hold on theÂ free trade agreement negotiationsÂ ahead of the G20 leaders summit, according to a senior official. Additionally, last week Canadaâ€™s Trade Minister Mary Ng postponed her trade mission to India set for October.Â  Also Read: US Firms Express Record Low Outlook Over Business In China, Blame Geopolitical Factors: Survey India-Canada Trade Ties The bilateral trade between India and Canada reached $8.16 billion in the fiscal year 2022-23, reported PTI.Â  India's exports to Canada, totaling $4.1 billion, consist of items such as pharmaceuticals, gems and jewelry, textiles, and machinery. On the other hand, Canada's exports to India, valued at $4.06 billion, include commodities like pulses, timber, pulp and paper, as well as mining products. Additionally, Canadian pension funds have expressed their commitment to continue investing in India due to the country's vast market potential and attractive returns on investment, the report said. As of the end of 2022, Canadian pension funds injected over $45 billion into India, making it the fourth-largest recipient of Canadian Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) globally. Key sectors attracting Canadian pension fund investments in India encompass infrastructure, renewable energy, Technology, and financial services. India and Canada also share a growing educational partnership, with more than 200 collaborative initiatives between Indian and Canadian educational institutions, as per the report. The enrollment of over 319,000 Indian students in Canadian institutions positions them as the largest group of international students in Canada, according to the GTRI. The Canadian Bureau for International Education (CBIE) reported that Indian students contributed $4.9 billion to the Canadian economy in 2021, constituting 20 per cent of all international students in Canada.\n",

The ECB in a statement said, \"Inflation continues to decline but is still expected to remain too high for too long. The governing council is determined to ensure that inflation returns to its 2 per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. The key ECB interest rates have reached levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to the target.\" According to an AFP report, the eurozone central bank has increased its lending rate for the 10th consecutive time as part of its aggressive effort, starting July last year, to combat rising inflation, which surged after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The current hike comes despite calls for a pause to support the struggling eurozone economy, marking the longest streak of rate hikes in the central bank's history. This rate is now at its highest level since the euro was introduced in 1999. The central bank believes that these rate increases have now reached a level that will help bring inflation back to its target. Some analysts interpret this move as a signal that the current cycle of rate hikes may be coming to an end, the report said.Â  The ECB also raised its forecast for inflation this year and next.Â  \"The September ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area see average inflation at 5.6 per cent in 2023, 3.2 per cent in 2024 and 2.1 per cent in 2025. This is an upward revision for 2023 and 2024 and a downward revision for 2025. The upward revision for 2023 and 2024 mainly reflects a higher path for energy prices,\" the bank said.Â  It also cut the forecasts for eurozone growth over the next three years, pointing to the impact of \"tightening on domestic demand and the weakening international trade environment.\" Also Read: Zee-Sony Merger: After IDBI Bank, Axis Finance Challenges NCLT Order Allowing $10 Billion Deal According to the AFP report, recent data indicates a deteriorating economic outlook in the eurozone, with second-quarter growth at just 0.1 per cent. The EU has also lowered its GDP forecasts for 2023 and 2024, citing particular weaknesses in Germany. The eurozone has been grappling with a sluggish economy, driven by factors like an industrial slowdown, high energy costs, and reduced exports, especially to China. The US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are scheduled to hold their own meetings next week.Â \n",

Massy with a message. â€” Mukesh Chhabra CSA (@CastingChhabra) September 6, 2023 Shah Rukh Khan's 'Jawan' was greeted by fans with a flurry of whistles, drumbeats, crackers and even his cut-out was bathed in milk. However, after being pirated online hours before its official release, Jawan is now freely downloadable on apps like Telegram and torrent websites. Fans of Shah Rukh Khan are miffed that 'Jawan' can be seen in mediocre quality on a number of websites. Some people were concerned that the movie's leak might affect how well it did at the box office.Â  A special screening of Jawan was hosted on Wednesday night at the YRF Studios, and several Bollywood celebrities were there. Deepika Padukone, Katrina Kaif, Suhana Khan, Mukesh Chhabra, and more celebrities were invited. Meanwhile, early estimates predict that the movie will earn more than Pathaan's opening-day total of Rs 57 crore and reach Rs 73 crore. Â According to industry tracker Sacnilk, the movie is anticipated to pull in Rs 65 crore from the Hindi market and Rs 4 crore each from the Tamil and Telugu markets, bringing the net total to Rs 73 crore. Â The movie is anticipated to earn Rs 84.50 crore collectively.

Addressing a press conference with AICC in-charge for Madhya Pradesh Randeep Singh Surjewala in Bhopal earlier in the day, Nath said this is not the first time the saffron party is using this ploy. Ahead of the 2019 general elections, too, the BJP had raked up issues like nationalism and surgical strike to divert the peopleâ€™s attention. â€œIndia is a country where a majority of people follow Sanatan Dharma. However, the BJP is trying to divert the attention from real issues and hence brought up the Sanatan Dharma controversy,â€ news agency PTI quoted Kamal Nath as saying. Addressing a rally in Madhya Pradeshâ€™s Sehore, Irani said, â€œThis is not just an election, it is a fight between Adharma and Dharma.

'Khufiya' looks intriguing, intense and a thriller that is fast paced. All this is complimented by a stellar cast headlined by the likes of Tabu and Ali Fazal. While Tabu seems to be playing a R&AW chief, Ali Fazal plays a photocopier in the department who seems to be passing on top-secret documents somewhere.Â  In between comes Wamiqa Gabbi, who plays the role of his wife. From the 'Khufiya' trailer, it is not clear if Ali Fazal is a patriot or traitor for leaking when it comes to national secrets.Â  The official synopsis of 'Khufiya' reads, \"Yahan hathiyaar ke roop hain alag, aur jung hai khufiya, in the world of spies, the traitor must be brought to light. #Khufiya, streaming from 5 October, only on Netflix!\" â€˜Khufiyaâ€™ is a spy-thriller film that follows Krishna Mehra (Tabu), who is an operative at the Research & Analysis Wing (R&AW). She is assigned to track down a mole selling India's defense secrets, while she grapples with her dual identity as a spy and lover. Directed by Vishal Bharadwaj, with a script written by Rohan Narula and Vishal, the movie stars Tabu, Ali Fazal, Wamiqa Gabi, Ashish Vidyarthi, Alexx O'Nell and Shataf Figar, will hit Netflix sometime in 2023.

The film is termed as a masala entertainer with high-octane stunts and a politically charged narrative.Â  Ahead of the filmâ€™s release, #BoycottJawan trended on social media for a while with some users calling for the film's boycott because it is distributed by Red Giant Movies in Tamil Nadu.

The controversy, however, didnâ€™t appear to gather much momentum.Â  Released in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu, â€˜Jawanâ€™ outlines \"the emotional journey of a man who is set to rectify the wrongs in the society\".

In 1989, he had signed Big B and Madhuri Dixit for a film titled 'Shanakht'. Narrating an incident from the film, Tinu, in a recent interaction, said he had an argument with Madhuri over her costume on the very first day of the shoot. Things got so heated up that he almost fired her from the film. In an interview with Radio Nasha, Tinu explained the scene where Amitabh was tied up in chains by the villain. \"He is trying to protect Madhuri but gets overpowered by the goons. So Madhuri's character says why are you attacking a man in chains when a woman is standing in front of you,\" Tinu recalls. Tinu then claimed that he had narrated the entire scene to Madhuri before she signed the movie. He recounts telling her that she would have to unbutton her blouse and stand in a bra while Amitabh would be chained to a carriage. \"I told her that you have to remove your blouse and for the first time, we should see you in your bra. And I am not going to hide anything behind a haystack or anything. Because you are offering yourself to help a man who is trying to help you. So it is a very important situation and I want to shoot it on the first day. She said okay,\" the actor-director recounts. Tinu said he asked Madhuri to design her own bra for the scene, but it had to be a bra and no other clothing. Talking about the day of shoot, Tinu said he waited for Madhuri Dixit to come on the set and when even after 45 minutes she did not come out of her room, he went in to check if everything was fine. Madhuri, on the other hand, hadn't even started getting ready for the scene. At the time for the shoot, Tinu said Madhuri refused to do the scene. \"I asked what happened. She said, 'Tinu, I don't want to do this particular scene.' I said, 'I'm sorry, you have to do this scene.' She said, 'No, I don't want to.' I said, 'Okay, pack up, say good bye to the film. I'll cancel my shoot.\" Later, Amitabh intervened to pacify the situation. Tinu recalls what Big B said, \"He said, 'Let it be, why are you arguing with her? If she has an objectionhellip;' I said, 'If she had to object, she should have done it earlier, before signing the film,'\" he said. However, Madhuri's secretary came in and assured Tinu that she would do the scene.\n",

            "Text: National Nutrition Week 2023: Impact Of Processed Food On Health Food items are processed so that they are available throughout the year in all seasons and at all stores. Processed foods are pre-cut vegetables and meat, as per quality checks, making it easy for people to finish their cooking as early as possible. Each has an expiration date mentioned on it for consumption. Fresh food is always preferred, as processing reduces the nutrient content and may even strip away antioxidants and vitamins like vitamin C, which are volatile in nature.Â  Talking about this, Rutu Dhodapkar, who is a member of the Dietetics Team at P D Hinduja Hospital and Medical Research Centre, Khar, \"Processed foods are not just microwave-based ready meals; they are processed to increase their shelf life and taste. They are made in such a way that they can be used for 6 months and above (the date of expiry is mentioned on them). Additives such as emulsifiers and preservatives are added to maintain the texture of foods, such as peanut butter, by preventing it from separating into solid and liquid parts.\" \"Heavily processed foods often include unHealthy levels of added sugar, sodium, and fat. These ingredients taste better when added, but extra consumption of them leads to serious Health issues like obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes lacking in nutritional value,\" she further went on to say. Rutu Dhodapkar also added, \"Researchers have mentioned that depression rates are 80% higher for those who eat ultra-processed foods. This includes chocolates, crips, biscuits, ice cream, and ready meals. Instant noodles are unHealthy as they are very high in sodium, low in fibre, and contain MSG (monosodium glutamate), which helps enhance flavour and give taste to the palate. The amount of MSG added is approved by the FDA; concerns regarding its use, whether short-term or long-term, accordingly affect your body.\" Some Common Processed Food Items That Affect Our Health: Dr. Manisha Choudhary, who is a Consultant â€“ Dietitian & Nutritionist at Motherhood Hospital, Noida said, \"Processed foods often contain a lot of calories but not many nutrients. Eating too much of them can lead to a lack of important vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that are necessary for good Health. The fast digestion of refined sugars and carbs in these foods can cause sudden increases in blood sugar, which can lead to problems like insulin resistance and diabetes.\" \"Moreover, excessive amounts of unHealthy trans fats and saturated fats are prevalent in processed foods. These can increase the risk of heart disease by blocking arteries and causing inflammation,\" she further added. Additionally, Mami Beheruk, who is the HOD of Dietitics at Sahyadri Super speciality hospital, Hadapsar, Pune, shared some of the common processed foods in our daily life which affects our Health severely. Carbonated Drinks - Carbonated drink contain sodium benzoate as preservative and aspartame, sucralose & saccharine as artificial sweeteners. Though the mentioned sweeteners are safe to consume in moderation but sodium benzoate is a harmful content and affects Health severely. When sodium benzoate is combined with food high in vitamin C, it can also be converted into a benzene, a compound that may be associated with cancer development. Apart from Carbonated drinks, Sodium benzoate is a preservative often added to acidic foods like salad dressings, pickles, fruit juices and condiments. Processed Meat - To increase the shelf life of meat, Sodium Nitrite is added as preservative. It prevents the growth of bacteria while also adding a salty flavour and reddish-pink colour. Sodium nitrite is a common ingredient in processed meats that can be converted into a harmful compound called nitrosamine. A higher intake of processed meats may be linked to a higher risk of several types of cancer. Packaged Juice/Candy/Breakfast Cereals - High-fructose corn syrup is used as sweetener in Packaged Juice/Candy/Breakfast Cereals & Food Snacks. Itâ€™s rich in simple sugar called fructose, which can cause serious Health issues when consumed in high amounts. High-fructose corn syrup is associated with weight gain, diabetes and inflammation. Itâ€™s also high in empty calories and contributes nothing but calories to your diet. Processed Dairy Products - To thicken the Milk/Curd and other Dairy Producst, Carrageenan is added. Derived from red seaweed, carrageenan acts as a thickener, emulsifier and preservative in many different food products. Commonly used in almond milk, cottage cheese, ice cream, coffee creamers and dairy-free products like vegan cheese. It increases the levels of fasting blood sugar and glucose intolerance, especially when combined with a high-fat diet. Bakery Products & Pizza - For better shelf life, Trans fats is added in bakery products & pizza. Trans Fats are a type of unsaturated fat that have undergone hydrogenation, which increases shelf life and improves the consistency of products. Eating Trans fats has been associated with many negative effects on Health, including inflammation, heart disease and diabetes. Frozen Food - Monosodium glutamate is a common food additive used to intensify and enhance the flavour of the product. Itâ€™s found in a variety of processed foods like frozen dinners, salty snacks and canned soups. Itâ€™s also often added to foods at restaurants and fast food places. MSG consumption is associated with weight gain and metabolic syndrome Apart from above major food items which poses serious Health issues, there are ingredients used to improve the aesthetic or taste of food. Following are the ingredients shared by Mami Beheruk: Artificial Food Colouring - Artificial food colouring is used to brighten and improve the appearance of everything from candies to condiments. In recent years, though, there have been many concerns about potential Health effects. Specific food dyes like Blue 1, Red 40, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 have been associated with allergic reactions in some people.Â Artificial food colouring may promote hyperactivity in children Artificial Flavouring -Â Artificial flavours are chemicals designed to mimic the taste of other ingredients. They can be used to imitate a variety of different flavours, from popcorn and caramel to fruit and beyond. More consumption artificial flavouring decreases the red blood production. How We Can Avoid Processed Food: One way to stop your intake of processed foods is to get back to cooking at home. That means using whole foods, such as vegetables, fruits, wholw grains, beans, fish and other nutrients. Here are some strategies for avoiding processed food: Hydrate with water: Aerated beverages; such as soda, sweetened tea and packed fruit juice are loaded with empty calories. Instead, quench your thirst with water, homemade buttermilk, lemon water. Make smart food swaps: We can replace highly processed foods with Healthy substitutes. For example, if you're craving Â for the of chips, instead of that make your own banana chips by lightly seasoning with salt and pepper then put it into air fryer or Â in the oven. If you feel tempted to eat ice cream, satisfy your sweet tooth by freezing ripe bananas and blending them to make your own homemade Healthy smoothie serve Meal preparation: If you're too busy to cook, you can avoid giving in to the convenience of eating fast food meals by planning ahead of time and preparing your meals at home for the week. To help, there are plenty of meal delivery services that can ship all the pre-portioned ingredients for you to make homemade meals. Step away from the frozen product:Â The frozen meats section is full of cold cuts, sausages and other processed meats. Instead, fill your shopping bag/cart with protein from the grocery store's meat and seafood where you'll find smart alternatives, such as chicken, salmon and prawns. For plant-based proteins, tofu, paneer chickpeas. We need to move away from eating processed foods and focus on eating whole, unprocessed foods instead. Eating fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and Healthy fats can give our bodies the essential nutrients it needs, while also reducing the amount of bad stuff like additives and too much sugar. As people who buy food, it's important to read labels, make good choices, and push for changes in the food system in order to take back our Health from processed foods.â€ Indian Superfoods That Can Be Consumed Instead: Our rich culinary heritage, when combined with informed choices, can pave the way for optimal Health. This National Nutrition Week, let's harness the power of local, nutrient-dense foods, grounding our lives in better Health and improved quality of life. In this regard, Dr Neeta Deshpande, who is the Chief Medical Officer at Elevate Now, highlighted the nutrients present in Indian superfoods: Imported Superfoods vs Local Legends: The allure of imported superfoods like berries and avocados is undeniable. However, while we keep hearing about the antioxidant properties of blueberries, little do people know that our local fruits like jamuns and guavas are even higher in nutritional value. Similarly, while quinoa is a superfood thatâ€™s been celebrated in recent years, Amaranth is a local ingredient that offers significantly higher proportions of protein, iron, magnesium, and potassium, at roughly half the cost!Â  The Carbohydrate Conundrum: The STARCH study (2014) in India found that the evaluated Indian population derived 64.1% of their energy from carbohydrates, notably above the maximum recommended limit of 60%. In a related finding, the ICMR-INDIAB national study indicated that by reducing daily carbohydrate intake by 15%, approximately 66% of participants experienced diabetes remission. However, when adjusting one's diet based on these findings, it's crucial to recognize that all carbs are not the same. While processed foods surge blood sugar levels due to their easily absorbable carbs, fiber-rich carbs from whole grains, beans, vegetables, and fruits are crucial for regulating blood sugar, cholesterol, and ensuring Healthy digestion. These fiber-rich carbs have been consistently linked to Healthier, longer lives. Fats: The Villain or the Hero? Fats, often viewed through a singular lens, are multifaceted in their roles.Â  Trans fats, most found in processed foods, are detrimental to Health, increasing the risk of heart disease, insulin resistance, and elevated cholesterol levels. Saturated fats occur in a wide variety of foods and should be consumed in moderation, since these are also linked to increasing the LDL or the bad cholesterol levels.Â  However, a balanced diet must include a good amount of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats which are found in nuts, eggs, cheese, yoghurt, olive oil, groundnut oil and fatty fish.Â  The Vegetarian Protein Puzzle: Contrary to the widespread belief, India's vegetarian cuisine isnâ€™t protein deficient. For instance, a cup of whole lentils contains about 18 grams of protein, nearly equivalent to the protein in 100 grams of chicken. Plus, legumes like chickpeas and kidney beans are both protein-rich and high in fiber. Including other protein rich sources like soya chunks, paneer, black chanas, and peanuts can be a great way of ensuring a well-balanced vegetarian diet. However, if one is on a low calorie vegetarian diet, then protein supplements may be required to meet daily dietary requirements. Modern Lifestyles & The Vitamin Challenge: Though modern lifestyles pose unique challenges, it's a fallacy that they invariably lead to vitamin deficiencies. Millets, like the iron-rich foxtail or calcium-laden ragi, have long been India's silent Health guardians. And how can we forget the humble spinach, a Vitamin K powerhouse, or bananas, those potassium-packed wonders? A skilled Healthcare professional can help with personalising some of these choices to your specific Health conditions â€“ for example, in patients living with diabetes and obesity, one also must think about the glycemic index of these foods and consume them in moderation.Â \n",

With a worldwide total of Rs 129 crore, the Atlee movie became the highest-grossing opener in Hindi cinema. However, many fans have noticed a striking connection between the plot of the action flick and the screenplay of another movie as the movie. A lot of people on social media have made the case that the plot of 'Jawan' is extremely similar to that of the 1989 Tamil film 'Thaai Naadu'. Many users have gone on to argue that 'Jawan' has been lifted completely from the 1989 movie. An internet user stated that Atlee's storyline was adapted from 'Thaai Naadu', which starred Sathyaraj in a dual role similar to Shah Rukh's father and son figures in 'Jawan'.Â  \"Jawaan Original Tamil Version - 1989,\" the user wrote.Â  à®œà®µà®¾à®©à¯ à®’à®°à®¿à®œà®¿à®©à®²à¯ à®¤à®®à®¿à®´à¯ à®µà¯†à®°à¯à®·à®©à¯ - 1989. pic.twitter.com/G0KD0u7Qb0 â€” à®®à®¾à®Ÿà®°à¯à®©à¯ à®¤à®¿à®°à®¾à®µà®¿à®Ÿà®©à¯ (@moderndravidan) September 7, 2023 Some people are alleging that the movie is a mash-up of several South films. #Jawan scenes copied from other movies? ðŸ¤”#JawanReview pic.twitter.com/i5FGsqLBm4 â€” RUDRAðŸ’« (@invincibl39) September 7, 2023 Story- copied Poster- copied That's jawan movie pic.twitter.com/YDECousNlJ â€” Samira (@Logical_Girll) September 6, 2023 Can anyone please confirm whether #Jawan copied scene from #Apocalypto ? pic.twitter.com/dWFDTplkWU â€” Entertainment Buzz (@Entertain_Buzz_) September 8, 2023 Deepika Padukone makes a special appearance in the pan-Indian movie, which is directed by Tamil filmmaker Atlee and stars Nayanthara and Vijay Sethupathi.Â Sanya Malhotra, Priyamani, Sunil Grover, and Ridhi Dogra are among the notable actors who appear in 'Jawan'.

The resort village is holding its annual \"Laziest Citizen\" contest that kicked off last month. The competition requires participants to lie down on mats for almost 24 hours a day. The event is now in its 26th day and only 7 out of the 21 competitors remain in the race to win the grand prize of $1,070 (approximately Rs 88,000.) The remaining contestants have been lying down on mats for 20 straight days and have already smashed last yearâ€™s record of 117 hours, reported the New York post. \"All of us feel good, excellent, there are no Health problems, they are pampering us, all we have to do is to remain lying down,\" said 2021 champion Dubravka Aksic to Reuters. While, Filip Knezevic, 23, a first-time contestant from the northern town of Mojkovac said he is confident of winning the event. \"We have everything we need here, company is fantastic, time goes by quickly,\" he said. According to the rules, standing or sitting is not allowed and amounts to immediate disqualification, but contestants are allowed to take 10 minutes break every eight hours to go to the toilet. However, they are allowed to sleep, eat, drink, read books, use their phones and laptops. Radonja Blagojevic, the organiser and owner of the resort while speaking to Reuters said the contest in the tiny Adriatic country started 12 years ago to mock a popular myth that labels Montenegrins as lazy.

The statement highlighted that the new projects in Madhya Pradesh will significantly boost industrial development within the state. As per the statement, the state-of-the-art Bina refinery, to be developed at a cost of about Rs 49,000 crore by the Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, is expected to produce approximately 1,200 Kilo-Tonnes Per Annum (KTPA) of ethylene and propylene. These are vital components for various sectors, including textiles, packaging, and pharmaceuticals. This initiative aligns with the Prime Minister's vision of 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat' and will reduce India's reliance on imports. Furthermore, the mega project is anticipated to generate employment opportunities and stimulate the growth of downstream industries in the petroleum sector. Modi will also lay the groundwork for ten additional projects during his visit, including a power and renewable energy manufacturing zone in Narmadapuram district, two IT parks in Indore, a mega industrial park in Ratlam, and six new industrial areas across Madhya Pradesh, it said.Â  Modi's focus on enhancing national connectivity will receive a significant boost with the inauguration of crucial rail sector projects in Raigarh, Chhattisgarh. These projects encompass the Chhattisgarh East Rail Project Phase-I, the third rail line between Champa to Jamga, the third rail line between Pendra Road to Anuppur, and the MGR (Merry-Go-Round) system connecting Talaipalli Coal Mine to NTPC Lara Super Thermal Power Station (STPS). These rail projects will not only enhance passenger and freight movement but also contribute to socioeconomic development in the region. The Chhattisgarh East Rail Project Phase-I is a key component of the PM Gati Shakti-National Master Plan for multi-modal connectivity, comprising a 124.8 km rail line from Kharsia to Dharamjaygarh, including a spur line to Gare-Pelma and three feeder lines connecting Chhal, Baroud, Durgapur, and other coal mines, according to the statement. The rail line, constructed at a cost of approximately Rs 3,055 crore, features electrified broad gauge level crossings, a free part double line with passenger amenities, and will facilitate coal transportation from the Mand-Raigarh coalfields in Raigarh, Chhattisgarh. In addition, to address sickle cell disease-related Health issues, particularly among tribal populations, Modi will distribute one lakh sickle cell counselling cards to the screened population. This distribution is part of the Prime Minister's National Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination Mission (NSAEM), which was launched in Shahdol, Madhya Pradesh, in July 2023, it said.Â \n",

Surprisingly, the transition proved highly successful as Pooja managed to forge a profound connection with the digital audience, ultimately emerging as a finalist on the popular show.During an interview with Siddharth Kannan, Pooja was asked about her thoughts on a magazine photoshoot alongside her father, Mahesh Bhatt, which had garnered significant attention. In response, she exhibited her characteristic candour, stating, â€œNo, because I see it very simple, and I think that unfortunately jo hota hai (what happens is), a frozen moment can be represented and misrepresented in anyway. Aur mujhe yaad hai Shah Rukh ne mujhe yeh kaha tha when you have daughters, jab hi aapke bacche chote hai (I remember Shah Rukh had told me that when you have daughters and when your child is small), how often a child just says, â€˜Mummy papa give me a kissâ€™. And they go this way. Main ab bhi is umar mein bhi wahi 10 pound ki bacchi hoon for my father. Vo jindagi bher wahi rahege for me (At this age also I am still a 10 pound child for my father. He will always remain that way for me).â€She further added, â€œSo it was a moment that was absolutely innocent which was captured. Aur uske connotation jo hai, jinko padhna hai vo padhenge, jinko dekhna hai vo dekhege. Aur main is cheej ko defend karne nahi baithi. Agar log baap aur beti ke rishte ko alag najariye se dekh sakte hai toh vo kuch bhi kar sakte hai. Fir hum baat karte hai family values ki. Bahut kamal ka joke hai (Whatever its connotations, people may read it as they want, they will see it as they wish I cannot defend it here. If you want to see the relation between a father and a daughter in a different way then you can do anything. And then we talk about family values. What an amazing joke).â€In the past, Mahesh Bhatt, who arrived at Bigg Boss OTT Season 2 to support his daughter Pooja Bhatt, had expressed his love and pride towards her as he emotionally revealed how the actress had been the biggest support to the family during tough and challenging times.Also Read: Mahesh Bhatt reviews Jawan; calls Shah Rukh Khan a superstar â€œwho uses their light to illuminate the worldâ€\n",

Following the subscription, RR Kabel's shares are set to list on stock exchanges on September 20. Under the new SEBI listing timeframe, IPO firms are required to complete their listing process within three working days (T+3) from the conclusion of the IPO. Notably, R R Kabel is voluntarily following the T+2 timeline, as SEBI has not made this deadline mandatory for IPO firms until December 1, 2023. \"Trading members of the exchange are hereby informed that effective from Wednesday, September 20, the equity shares of R R Kabel Ltd shall be listed and admitted to dealings on the exchange in the list of 'B' Group of Securities,\" according to a circular issued by the BSE.Â  In August, the SEBI reduced the timeline for listing shares on stock exchanges after the conclusion of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) from six days (T+6) to three days (T+3). This revised listing timeframe will be voluntary for all public issues launched on or after September 1, and it will become obligatory for all issues starting December 1, 2023. The shortened timelines for listing and trading of shares will offer advantages to both issuers and investors, as per the market regulator.Â  Ratnaveer Precision Engineering was the first company to list under the T+3 regime.Â  Also Read: PLI Schemes For Pharma, Textiles, Drones May Soon Be Tweaked: Report R R Kabel IPO R R Kabel's Initial Public Offering (IPO) consists of a fresh issue amounting to Rs 180 crore and an offer-for-sale (OFS) segment comprising up to 1.72 crore equity shares. The IPO, valued at Rs 1,964 crore, garnered a subscription rate of 18.69 times. It was open for subscription from September 13 to September 15, with a price range of Rs 983 to Rs 1,035 per share. Among the investor categories, the Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) segment saw an overwhelming subscription rate of 52.26 times, as per exchange data. Non-institutional investors displayed strong interest, with a subscription rate of 13.23 times, while retail individual investors subscribed 2.13 times. R R Kabel, a part of the R R Global Group, intended to use Rs 136 crore of the net proceeds from the fresh issue to reduce its debt. This TPG-backed company operates five manufacturing units, including cable and wire facilities in Waghodia (Gujarat) and Silvassa (Dadra and Nagar Haveli), as well as a commercial lighting plant in Bengaluru.Â  The company intends to utilize the proceeds from the fresh issue to repay debt amounting to Rs 136 crore, with the remainder allocated for general corporate purposes. As per a Mint report, Market observers say the grey market premium (GMP) for RR Kabel's IPO was Rs 96 per share on September 19.Â  Considering the upper end of the IPO price range and the existing premium in the grey market, the estimated listing price for RR Kabel's IPO shares is Rs 1,131, representing a 9.3 per cent increase over the IPO price of Rs 1,035.

The two corporate giants will collaborate to construct AI infrastructure that surpasses the computing capabilities of India's fastest supercomputer by more than tenfold. Nvidia will provide access to its cutting-edge Technology, including the Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip and the Nvidia DGX Cloud â€” an AI supercomputing service hosted in the cloud. The GH200 Superchip represents a fundamental breakthrough in computing architecture, offering remarkable performance and unparalleled memory bandwidth. This Nvidia-powered AI infrastructure will lay the groundwork for Reliance Jio Infocomm, the telecommunications arm of Reliance Industries, to explore new frontiers in AI. The global AI revolution is reshaping industries and daily life, and to harness India's vast potential in AI, Reliance will develop AI applications and services for its 450 million Jio customers. Furthermore, they will offer energy-efficient AI infrastructure to scientists, developers, and startups across India. AI has the potential to enable rural farmers to access weather information and crop prices in their local languages via mobile phones. It can facilitate large-scale expert medical diagnosis based on symptoms and imaging scans in areas where immediate access to doctors may be limited. Additionally, AI can enhance the prediction of cyclonic storms using decades of atmospheric data, thereby aiding timely evacuations and shelter finding for those at risk. The AI infrastructure will be hosted in AI-ready data centres, with plans to expand to a staggering 2,000 MW. Execution and implementation will be overseen by Jio, leveraging its extensive expertise in mobile telephony, 5G spectrum, fibre networks, and more. Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, expressed enthusiasm for the partnership, stating, \"We are delighted to partner with Reliance to build state-of-the-art AI supercomputers in India. India has scale, data, and talent. With the most advanced AI computing infrastructure, Reliance can build its own large language models that power generative AI applications made in India, for the people of India.\" Reliance Jio's broad expertise, infrastructure, and engineering capabilities make it well-suited to deploy and manage the new AI computing infrastructure. This collaboration with Nvidia is aligned with its strategy of becoming a comprehensive digital, cloud, and networking platform for both consumers and Business customers. Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries, emphasised the significance of the partnership, stating, \"As India advances from a country of data proliferation to creating Technology infrastructure for widespread and accelerated growth, computing and Technology super centres like the one we envisage with Nvidia will provide the catalytic growth just like Jio did to our nationâ€™s digital march.\" Akash Ambani, Chairman of Reliance Jio Infocomm, echoed this sentiment, saying, \"At Jio, we are committed to fueling Indiaâ€™s Technology renaissance by democratising access to cutting-edge technologies, and our collaboration with Nvidia is a significant step in this direction. Together, we will develop a state-of-the-art AI cloud infrastructure that is secure, sustainable, and deeply relevant across India, accelerating the nationâ€™s journey towards becoming an AI powerhouse.\"\n",

            "Text: Revolutionising Investment Landscape: How Zero-Cost Brokerage Redefined The Game By Tajinder Virk The dynamic nature of the global financial markets is often narrated through captivating anecdotes, where seemingly inconsequential events trigger seismic shifts across the worldwide markets. At times, these shifts result in utter chaos, but more often they are manageable. Such inherent unpredictability contributes to greater risk in the world of capital investments. In the midst of these turbulent waters, the exorbitant commissions levied by brokerage service providers in the name of enabling investments end up siphoning away a significant chunk of potential returns. The practice of paying brokerage fees has for long been embedded in the investment landscape. However, in a world where investors shoulder the very risks linked to their chosen investments, the notion of brokers claiming a slice of these investments as facilitation fees is increasingly coming under scrutiny. Any form of taxation, whether it's a stamp duty on real estate transactions or brokerage charges on stock trades, is usually unwelcome on part of the party paying the tax. Brokerage fees are not different, practically being a tax on investment capital, a major roadblock in the investment journey of numerous traders that dilutes potential gains and inadvertently dampens investor enthusiasm. In the grand scheme, this Business model becomes self-defeating: as traders engage in more frequent trading, brokers reap short-term benefits while traders suffer prolonged losses. This leads to an unsustainable cost structure to retain traders or investors, eventually driving them away from the capital markets. This underscores the detrimental effects of excessive brokerage charges, discouraging active participation and undermining the long-term stability of the financial ecosystem. A Paradigm Shift Through Technological Advancements The financial markets landscape has undergone a monumental transformation with the rise of Technology, introducing discount brokers and zero-cost trading platforms that render capital market investments enticing for retail investors. The rationale behind tech-driven brokerage firms offering zero-cost services is strikingly straightforward. For example, sending messages on platforms like WhatsApp does not incur any extra charges. Brokers essentially function as the transmitters of the â€˜execution messagesâ€™ on exchange servers, which makes brokerage fees completely impractical from both a technological and cost standpoint, since these processes are remarkably analogous. The exorbitant charges exacted by brokers warrant meticulous examination. As time has progressed, investors have increasingly questioned the logic behind these fees, particularly as alternative platforms emerge that offer comparable services without the cumbersome financial burden. As the investment landscape evolves, it is imperative to reassess the basis for these fees and explore strategies to harmonise them with the prevailing technological and economic realities. The Toll of Broking Charges Imagine a scenario where an individual engages in day trading, which is subject to brokerage and clearing fees. Further to this, let's assume this investor maintains a portfolio of Rs 10 Lakh and conducts one trade per day at a 10X leverage rate (typical for intraday or derivatives trading). Now letâ€™s get to the financials part. The user pays a discount broker an average of Rs 100 in commissions and clearing fees for every Rs 1 Crore transaction, whether buying or selling with 10X leverage. Consequently, the total yearly cost sums up to Rs 200, spanning commissions, clearing charges, and administrative or ticket fees. With an average of 252 trading days annually, the investor faces about Rs 50,000 in annual brokerage and clearing charges. Remarkably, this amounts to nearly 5 per cent of the investor's portfolio being relinquished to the broker solely for accessing the trading platform. Compared to this, the interest earned by depositing the same amount in a bank account surpasses the brokerage expenses incurred. While factoring in the additional risks intrinsic to the stock market, the returns may not outweigh the exorbitant brokerage costs for a considerable portion of investors. With a 50 per cent chance of each investment being profitable, investors may find redirecting their funds from the capital markets to banks increasingly appealing. The Dawn of Zero-Cost Broking The zero-cost broking concept arose from a thought-provoking query: if the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is freely accessible, why should traders bear the brunt of brokerage costs when transmitting messages about financial exchange protocols? Leveraging technological platforms, broking firms can operate with minimal overheads, negating the necessity for high fees. As a consequence, discount brokers can enable trading anytime, anywhere through user-friendly smartphone apps. With growing awareness of the impact of excessive fees on investment returns, investors are seeking alternatives that offer transparent and cost-effective solutions.

Now with the World Cup coming up, he understands the dynamics of one-day cricket quite well and knows that he has to pick players who have that kind of an attacking mindset,â€ Karim told JioCinema. â€œHe also knows that in his bowling lineup, he needs to have out of six, at least five wicket-taking options and if he has Ashwin in the eleven, then that attacking option is available. If you look at all the other players who are in the reserve â€“ they all have that attacking mindset. So, I think Rohit Sharma wants to continue with this aggressive approach that we saw the Indian team play in the Asian challenge.â€ Karim further spoke about Shreyas Iyer's selection in the squad as well. â€œI am glad that they are persisting with Shreyas Iyer. It really shows that the team management and selectors trust him so much. And Shreyas has played a very vital role in the one-day setup. So, I am happy to see that they are backing him right till they announce the World Cup side. â€œI donâ€™t think there should be any issue with him being part of the side if he's fit, even if he does not score runs in these two or three games â€“ it does not matter. You need to back players who have done well for you in the past and they in any case get three ODI games here plus the two practice matches. The kind of player Shreyas Iyer is â€“ I am pretty excited for him to get back into the fold and score runs at the right time for the Indian side.â€ (This report has been published as part of the auto-generated syndicate wire feed.

The markets regulator barred Girish Talwalkar, Prashant Talwalkar, Madhukar Talwalkar, Vinayak Gawande, Anant Gawande, Harsha Bhatkal, and Girish Nayak for varying periods. The companies include Talwalkars Better Value Fitness Ltd. (TBVFL) and Talwalkars Healthclubs Ltd. (THL), reported PTI. The regulator levied penalties for flouting disclosure norms and PFUTP (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices), it revealed in two separate orders. While Girish Talwalkar, Prashant Talwalkar, Anant Gawande, and Harsha Bhatkal have received a fine of Rs 36 lakh each from the regulator, Rs 24 lakh fine has been imposed on Vinayak Gawande and Madhukar Talwalkar, and a fine of Rs 12 lakh has been levied on THL. TBVFL has been slapped with a fine of Rs 24 lakh and Girish Nayak has been asked to pay a fine of Rs 18 lakh.Â  With regards to TBVFL, Sebi also imposed a securities market ban on Girish Talwalkar, Prashant Talwalkar, Madhukar Talwalkar, Vinayak Gawande, Anant Gawande, Harsha Bhatkal, and Girish Nayak for 18 months and restricted them from being associated with any listed company or any intermediary registered with Sebi for the same time period.Â  The regulator also banned Girish Talwalkar, Prashant Talwalkar, Anant Gawande, Harsha Bhatkal and, Girish Nayak from the market for 18 months with regards to THL and the debarment will start after the expiration of the period of restraints levied on the individuals and company in case of TBVFL.Â  Sebi received various complaints against the two companies in 2019 from August to October period. The complaints alleged a default in interest payment on term loans in spite of a significant cash balance.Â  According to the results of the companies for the financial year ending March 2019, both TBVFL and THL reported a total cash balance of around Rs 77 crore and the total default on interest payment stood at Rs 3.5 crore (term loan), as of July 2019. This created a doubt about the validity of their account books.Â  After itâ€™s preliminary examination, the regulator initiated a detailed investigation and KPMG was named the forensic auditor to assist the investigating authority in conducting an examination of the account books for both companies for a period of four fiscal years from 2016-17 to 2019-20.Â  Post this, Sebi began an inquiry into the companies on the suspicion that their financials were being misrepresented to paint a Healthy picture in front of the investors. In itâ€™s order, the regulator found that both companies misreported their financial statements by inflating their bank balance, revenue, advances given to connected companies without rationale, and much more.Â  Sebi's Executive Director, V S Sundaresan, noted in two separate orders, â€œI find that an act of concealment of information related to mis-utilisation of funds by a listed company, which if disclosed would have the potential to impact the share price of that listed company, is undoubtedly fraudulent and unfair trade practice relating to the securities market and covered under the PFUTP Regulations. I am of the view that by disseminating financial statements through the platform of stock exchanges(s) or otherwise, THL and TBVFL has attempted to demonstrate a rosy picture of its affairs, which was clearly misleading and was designed to influence the decisions of the investors dealing in its securities and thereby likely to induce sale and/or purchase in its securities, and thus, in effect has violated the PFUTP Regulations.â€ Also Read : Government Increases Windfall Tax On Domestic Crude, Reduces Duty On Diesel, ATF Exports\n",

Pakistan captain Babar Azam won the toss and chose to field first in this match but after that it was the Indian openers who put on a great batting performance to put India in a solid position.Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill may have failed the first time around Pakistan, on this occasions there was no stopping the duo. While Rohit became the first batter in international cricket to hit Afridi for a six in the first over of an innings, Gill also took the attack to him forcing skipper to give him a short spell with the new ball. However, Naseem Shah's spell with the new ball was spot on as he hit the right areas and batters found it tough against him.He almost got rid of Gill as he induced an outside edge off his bat but it do went to hand and instead went through the slip cordan with each fielder expecting the other to go for it.

            "Text: Social Media Platforms Should Have A Minimum Age Limit Of 21 For Users, Karnataka HC Suggests The Karnataka High Court proposed on Tuesday that the Central government should contemplate establishing a minimum age requirement for accessing social media, aiming to restrict usage by minors, as reported by PTI. During deliberations on the potential hazards of exposing children to social media, a bench comprising Justices G. Narender and Vijaykumar A. Patil recommended this measure. The Court recommended either implementing a ban on social media or setting a minimum age of 21 for users, highlighting concerns about the addictive nature of these platforms for school-going children and questioning their maturity to discern national interests at the age of 17 or 18 when compared to the voting age of 21. These comments were made during the concluding part of the hearing concerning an appeal by X Corp (previously known as Twitter) related to the Centre's directives to block specific tweets and accounts in 2021 and 2022. The Court is set to announce its decision on the interlocutory applications (IAs) tomorrow. The counsel representing the Central government informed the Court that current legislation mandates users to provide Aadhaar and other documentation to access specific online games. In response, the Court raised the question of why similar measures were not being applied to social media platforms. The Court expressed concerns that adjustments might be necessary to ensure that intermediaries like X Corp are protected from potential legal action by account holders, especially when complying with takedown requests while maintaining confidentiality. The bench stressed the need for a clear framework and immunity for such intermediaries based on specific rules and guidelines. Furthermore, the Court highlighted that X Corp should not be expected to make subjective judgments on content removal, emphasising the importance of assessing whether the content in question violates the Information Technology Act, 2000, Section 69A (1) and (2). The Court emphasised that compliance with blocking orders is required only when a violation of these provisions is evident. Meanwhile, X Corp's counsel clarified that the appeal's challenge was limited to the earlier observations made by a single judge regarding the interpretation of laws on post and account blocking. It was stated that X Corp has since complied with the previously contested demands to block posts and accounts. However, concerns were raised regarding the lack of sufficient reasons provided for requesting the takedown of over 1,000 tweets. The Court acknowledged these concerns, particularly related to the justification and reasons behind the Central government's blocking orders, emphasising the need for proper justifications to protect social media intermediaries from potential legal action by users. The case initially began with Twitter challenging certain blocking orders issued by the Indian government, resulting in a single judge of the Karnataka High Court rejecting the challenge and imposing a Rs 50 lakh fine on the social media platform for perceived delays in compliance with block requests. Subsequently, the microblogging platform appealed this decision, and on August 10, a division bench of the High Court stayed the single judge's order, subject to X Corp depositing Rs 25 lakhs to demonstrate its good faith. The matter is scheduled to be revisited tomorrow for the pronouncement of orders on the interlocutory applications.\n",

The actor disclosed that he has been in a committed relationship for the past seven years, shedding light on his romantic journey.In an interview ETimes, Sooraj revealed that, surprisingly, his relationship with Jiah Khan was his shortest one. He expressed, â€œI think my relationship with Jiah was probably the shortest relationship I have had. After that, I have been in one relationship and itâ€™s been about seven years now, and it is beautiful. Thereâ€™s nothing in the world that can match up to the feeling of being in love, being taken care of, and doing the same for the other person. For me, this relationship itâ€™s very personal because many have judged me unfairly as a bad lover or partner, but only those close to me know how I am. The general perception is misconstrued.â€While Sooraj chose to keep his partner's identity discreet, he affirmed that she is not an actress and therefore preferred not to divulge her name. He elaborated, â€œShe is not an actress and hence, I wouldnâ€™t want to divulge her identity. Besides, I prefer to keep my relationship private because so much about me is out there already.â€ As for his future plans, especially regarding marriage, Sooraj hinted at the possibility, stating, â€œMaybe, in a few years.â€For the unversed, Sooraj Pancholi, who was in a relationship with Jiah Khan when she died, was accused of abetting her commit suicide by Jiah's mother Rabi Khan after a big argument between the two. However, on April 28, the court acquitted the Sooraj of all charges, stating that there was insufficient evidence linking him to the abetment. Sooraj, the son of Zarina and Bollywood actor Aditya Pancholi, made his Bollywood debut in 2015 with the movie Hero, alongside Athiya Shetty. He appeared in court on the same day, accompanied by his mother and actress Zarina Wahab.Almost ten years before, on June 3, 2013, Jiah's mother Rabia Khan discovered her daughter hanging from the ceiling of her home in Mumbai's Juhu neighbourhood. The Juhu Police detained actor Suraj Pancholi, Jiah Khan's then-boyfriend, for aiding suicide after a 6-page letter allegedly written by Jiah was discovered at her home. It was asserted that the suicide letter was evidence against Suraj and that it represented their turbulent relationship.Also Read: Sooraj Pancholi performs Dhwaja Pujan at Somnath Ji temple, Gujarat following acquittal in Jiah Khan case; see pictures\n",

            "Text: Straighter run-up, aggressive rhythm key to my ODI success: Kuldeep Yadav Colombo, September 12 Left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav believes tweaks in his technique, including a straighter run-up and an aggressive rhythm, has helped him to improve his bowling and achieve success in ODI cricket. The 28-year-old has taken 27 wickets from 14 matches this year, the highest by an Indian bowler in ODIs. \"After the (knee) surgery (last year), my run-up has become much straighter, and rhythm has become aggressive. My hand used to fall over but that has been controlled and now it (hand) is facing the batsman,\" said Kuldeep in the post-match press conference. Kuldeep said he had worked on spin and drift post his surgery to improve his efficiency. \"I exerted care not to lose my spin and drift without losing my pace. If a leg-spinner lands the ball on a good length, he can pick up wickets more regularly and loose balls can be reduced. You can be consistent,\" he added. Kuldeep said he worked with NCA physio Ashish Koushik post his surgery to reduce the burden on his knee while landing in the crease. \"I did not want to lose my zip, nip or drift. After surgery I went for a three-month recuperation at NCA and physio Ashish Koushik said I had to reduce the load on my knee. So, I worked to make my rhythm faster,\" he said. However, Kuldeep said it took him some time to make the remodelled action work at the top level cricket. \"I tried the new action in a practice game in Kanpur. The batsmen were struggling to face me. But even in the IPL and during the tour of the West Indies I was struggling with it (action). \"It took some 6-7 matches for me to make work at this level,\" said Kuldeep. 'Performing against a top opposition like Pakistan motivates me' His (5/25) five-wicket haul helped India outclass Pakistan by a massive 228-run margin and Kuldeep said he will always remember this effort as it came against a top opposition. \"I will always remember that I picked up five wickets against Pakistan when I retire. It is a big thing for me because Pakistan players can play spin well. If you perform against a side that plays spin well in the subcontinent, it motivates you,\" said he said.\n",

            "Text: The Last Of Us At Halloween Horror Nights Captures Something The Games And TV Show Can't It's been a big year for The Last of Us. Not only did the original game finally come to PC in 2023, but we also got the beloved live-action adaptation on HBO. Still, even with The Last of Us occupying a big space in pop culture, Naughty Dog, the studio behind the game series, wasn't finished. There was one last frontier for The Last of Us to conquer: Halloween Horror Nights.Each year, Universal Studios in Orlando, FL and Los Angeles, CA present its celebration of horror with haunted mazes dotting both theme parks, often inspired by well-known franchises. This year, The Last of Us made the cut. Surprisingly, though, Universal didn't adapt the TV show. Instead, it's the original game that has been converted into an immersive experience at the popular theme parks.The Last of Us experience at Universal is two years in the making, with plans for the attraction going into motion after the game's writer Neil Druckmann tweeted how much he'd love to see Joel and Ellie's adventures be part of the annual festivities. According to Druckmann himself, speaking at a Halloween Horror Nights media event, it took less than 24 hours for someone from the parks to reach out and get the ball rolling. Now, fans on each coast can find themselves immersed in The Last of Us in a way the game and the TV show could never accomplish.\"There's something really special about this experience, but how do you articulate it? You want to put the players in the game,\" Druckmann told GameSpot. \"And you can argue, 'Well, they're already in the game. They're playing as Joel, they're turning the camera on. They're deciding what they're doing.' Yes, but they're seeing it through a 2D frame on their wall. And what if you break that frame and now they're surrounded by it, and you can walk, and you can touch it, and you can feel it, you could smell it. And it's a different kind of an emotional experience.\"It's truly something the show or games can't accomplish, with guests able to touch the various environments and items throughout the maze, before finding themselves face-to-face with an infected person while the smell of something putrid lingers in the air. For Druckmann and the team at Universal Studios, though, it wasn't enough just to recreate the atmosphere of the games for guests to explore. There also needed to be familiar faces.\"Then [you must] add the Joel and Ellie experience and really feel like you're on a journey with them,\" he explained. \"It felt like you could give them something that they would draw from the game or draw from the show, but have a different kind of experience.\"Of course, Druckmann also insisted one of his favorite things about having a maze at Halloween Horror Nights is the \"incredibly high production values, and it's here for this limited time, and then it's gone.\" If you don't catch it at the parks on either coast this year, you'll never experience this take on The Last of Us again, which is certainly an interesting selling point for superfans.Another point of interest is that this isn't just a single maze that was made on both coasts. The experiences in Florida and California are different--something Universal Studios strives for when the parks take on similar intellectual property.Of course, Druckmann would only tease what the differences between the two mazes are, saying, \"There's some amazing stuff that's only here and some really amazing stuff that's only there.\"Ultimately, though, either one should be a worthwhile destination if you love The Last of Us. Not only did the game's stars Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson record new dialogue just for Halloween Horror Nights, but Universal's creative team was given a treasure trove of assets by Naughty Dog, allowing the theme parks to recreate the sounds, sights, and feeling of the game.It allows Universal to create an immersive world where, while you know zombies aren't a thing and The Last of Us is a video game, it's easy to fall prey to infected shambling in the shadows or Ellie popping out from behind a wall, determined to protect you. And that's exactly what Druckmann and Naughty Dog wanted from the collaboration.\"For us at Naughty Dog, our approach is always: Let's do a few things and let's make sure they're the best. They're excellent,\" he said. \"So we've had people approach us to do similar experiences, but it wouldn't have been up to this level of quality.\"Halloween Horror Nights runs on select nights through Halloween at Universal Orlando Resort and Universal Studios Hollywood.\n",

Additionally, they have also assured the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) that they will clear 90 per cent of the dues for the June quarter, including interest payments, in a phased manner, the report said citing DoT officials.Â  According to the company's first-quarter earnings, VI's total gross debt as of June 30, 2023 stood at Rs 2,117.6 billion which includes deferred spectrum payment obligations of Rs 1,337.4 billion, AGR liability of Rs. 668.6 billion that is due to the government, debt from banks and financial institutions of Rs. 95 billion and optionally convertible debentures amounting to Rs. 16.6 billion. The report said that DoT officials said that as long as the company adheres to its payment schedules, the department will refrain from using the bank guarantees. However, if the company fails to meet its commitments, the guarantees will be cashed.Â  \"They (Vi) have written to us that significant progress has been made with several groups of investors but nothing specific has been informed by the company,\" an official told the ET. \"Once the promoters infuse the Rs 2,000 crore into the company, there may be some movement on external funding,\" another government official was quoted as saying.Â  The report noted that as of now the government holds the largest stake in the company at 33.1 per cent. However, it maintains a hands-off approach to the company's day-to-day operations. Over the past two years, the government has granted several extensions for statutory payments, given that VI has been paying interest to compensate for the delays. Additionally, recent telecom reforms have eliminated provisions for imposing penalties. Also Read: G20 Summit: Number Of Countries Have Shown Interest In Using UPI, Says RBI Executive Director Vodafone Idea has encountered challenges in raising funds during this period, impacting its ability to expand its 4G network and initiate the 5G rollout. This financial constraint puts VI at a disadvantage compared to competitors such as Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel. According to the report, VI CEO Akshaya Moondra has told DoT that they are close to arranging a Rs 4,000-crore short-term loan from the SBI to pay for its pending statutory dues as well as spectrum installment. The company has requested a 30-day extension to fulfill its payment obligation for the 2022 spectrum auction installment. The original due date for this installment, amounting to Rs 1,680 crore, was set for August 17. However, Vodafone Idea (VI) has been granted a 30-day extension, subject to interest charges. Notably, while the government had provided a four-year payment moratorium for payments related to past auctions, the 2022 spectrum auction was not included in this arrangement. The payment moratorium is set to end in the third quarter of the 2025-26 fiscal year. Following this, VI will be required to make annual regulatory payments exceeding Rs 40,000 crore, the report said.\n",

However, it seems like he escaped unhurt as the star pacer continued his spell and moreover ended up dismissing Pathum Nissanka in his next over.Â  Watch below viral video: Jasprit Bumrah suffers massive injury scare during IND vs SL Asia Cup 2023 Super 4s match in Colombo Bumrah is totally me,bad ankle ðŸ¥¹ðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆ #INDvSL #indvspak2023 #SLvsIND #Bumrah #AsiaCup2023 pic.twitter.com/DUyO7AwbNC â€” HariKrish (@krishtweets_HK) September 12, 2023 Bumrah bhai sambhal kr No more injury ðŸ™‚#INDvSL â€” POINT TOH HAI (@on_point_22) September 12, 2023 For the unversed, Jasprit Bumrah missed tons of cricketing action after suffering a back injuryÂ back in September 2022. One of the best Indian pacers of all time, Bumrah missed being part of the national team in last year's T20 World Cup and 2023 season of IPL due to rehabilitation. The lethal right-arm fast bowler made his much-awaited India comeback with a T20I series against Ireland and is surely expected to play a major role for the Men in Blue in the upcoming ICC Men's ODI World Cup 2023, scheduled to kickstart in October. Coming back to IND vs SL Asia Cup 2023 Super 4s game, India won the toss and decided to bat first.

The Men in Blue remain the only undefeated in the tournament so far and have deservingly sealed a place in the final of the continental tournament. Even though their first match of the Group A ended without any result with rain playing spoilsport, India thrashed Nepal by 10 wickets in their second match to book a place for themselves in the Super Four.Â Rohit Sharma & Co. then registered a record win by 228 runs over Pakistan in their first Super Four contest at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. They were then challenged by Sri Lanka in their next Super Four clash but found a way to come out on top as they won by 41 runs to seal a place for themselves in the final and knock Bangladesh out of contention.Even though India have a Super Four match against Bangladesh remaining, they are already assured of a place in the summit clash. But who they meet in the titular contest will depend on who wins the match between Sri Lanka and Pakistan, which is a virtual semifinal. What Happens If Rain Plays Spoilsport In SL vs PAK?In case, rain plays spoilsport in SL vs PAK Super Four fixture, both the teams will be forced to share points and will end up 3 points from 3 matches. In such a scenario, it will be the Net Run Rate (NRR) which will come into picture to decide who forges ahead in the competition. That would mean bad news for Pakistan since their NRR has taken a beating after the heavy defeat to India and currently stands at -1.892, the lowest among the four teams. Sri Lanka, by contast, have a better NRR of -0.200 and if rain abandons play in Colombo on September 14 (Thursday), then they would be the side against India in the final.\n",

Uncertainty Looms Over Right-Arm Pacer's Availability Colombo: Pakistan's captain, Babar Azam, has raised concerns about the possibility of fast bowler Naseem Shah's timely recovery for their initial matches in the upcoming World Cup in India. However, there's better news regarding their star pacer Haris Rauf, who is \"recovering well\" from a side strain and is expected to be fit for their opening match against the Netherlands in Hyderabad on October 6. Both Naseem and Haris sustained injuries during Pakistan's Super Four clash against India in the Asia Cup and were sidelined as the team exited the tournament following a loss to Sri Lanka in Colombo. The Pakistan Cricket Board has not yet provided an official timeline for Naseem's recovery from a right shoulder injury. In light of this uncertainty, Babar Azam expressed doubts about Naseem's fitness for the start of the World Cup. While addressing the situation, Babar Azam mentioned, \"I'll tell you later... Not revealing our Plan B at this moment. But, yes, Haris Rauf is making good progress. He's dealing with a minor side strain, and he's expected to recover before the World Cup.\" Regarding Naseem Shah's condition, Babar added, \"Naseem Shah also... they have a couple of mismatches, I don't know how long the recovery will take, but in my opinion, Naseem Shah will also be available for the World Cup later on. But let's see.\" Naseem Shah, who is just 20 years old, has had a history of injuries, including a back problem at the age of 17 that sidelined him for 14 months. After his return, he suffered a shoulder injury during his debut appearance in the County Championship with Gloucestershire, keeping him out of action for an additional month. Although initially known as a red-ball specialist, he has evolved into a key bowler for Pakistan in all three formats of the game. In ODIs, Naseem has emerged as Pakistan's most potent bowler, claiming 32 wickets in just 14 matches, all at an average of less than 17. Teams have until September 28 to submit their squads to the ICC for the six-week tournament, and they can only make changes to their 15-player squads after that date with the permission of the event organizers. Pakistan doesn't have any official 50-over matches scheduled before the World Cup, but they do have two warm-up games against New Zealand (on September 29) and Australia (on October 3), although these games do not hold official ODI status.(With Inputs From PTI)\n",

            "Text: World Alzheimer's Day 2023: Does Genetics Play A Role In Alzheimer's? See What Experts Say Alzheimerâ€™s disease is the most common type of dementia. It is a progressive disease beginning with mild memory loss and possibly leading to loss of the ability to carry on a conversation and respond to the environment. Alzheimerâ€™s disease involves parts of the brain that control thought, memory, and language. It can seriously affect a personâ€™s ability to carry out daily activities. There are two main types of Alzheimer's: familial and sporadic. Familial Alzheimer's is a rare form that is directly linked to genetic mutations, while sporadic Alzheimer's is more common and has a complex genetic component. Â  Dr Aparna Rajadhyaksha, who is a Senior Consultant - Molecular Genomics and Genetics Expert, at Metropolis Healthcare Limited said, \"The prevalence of dementia in India is 7.4% among adults over the age of 60. That is, about 8.8 million Indians are currently living with dementia. By 2050, over 75% of cases of Alzheimerâ€™s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are expected to occur in low-and middle-income countries.\" \"In most cases, Alzheimerâ€™s does not have a single genetic cause. Instead, it can be influenced by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors. Consequently, a person may carry more than one gene or group of genes that can either increase or reduce the risk of Alzheimerâ€™s. People who develop Alzheimerâ€™s do not always have a history of the disease in their families. Still, those who have a parent or sibling diagnosed with the disease have a higher risk of developing Alzheimerâ€™s than those without that association,\" she added. Role Of Genetics In Alzheimer's Disease: Â  Dr Kailas Mirche, who is a Neurologist at Citizens Specialty Hospital, Hyderabad said, \"Genetics plays a significant role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. While it is not solely a genetic disorder, a person's genetic makeup can increase their susceptibility to the disease.\" Â  \"Mutations in certain genes, such as APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2, are associated with familial Alzheimer's and can lead to the early onset of the disease, often in a person's 30s to 60s. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene variants, particularly APOE Îµ4, are the most well-established genetic risk factors for sporadic Alzheimer's. Carrying one or two copies of the APOE Îµ4 allele increases the risk and lowers the age of onset,\" he further added. Â  Dr Kailas Mirche continued to say that a genetic predisposition does not guarantee someone will develop Alzheimer's, and conversely, not having these genetic factors does not guarantee immunity. Additionally, environmental factors and lifestyle choices also play a critical role in disease development. Â  The Two Groups Of Alzheimer's Genes: Dr. Shamsheer Dwivedee, who is the Director of Department of Neurology (MIND) at Max Super Specialty Hospital, Dehradun said, \"There are two groups of Alzheimer related genes - 'At risk genes' and 'Deterministic genes'.Â  Dr. Sajid Mairaj, who is a Senior Consultant Physician and Diabetologist at Prayag Hospitals Group went on to talk about these two types of genes: Risk genes, like APOE-e4, increase the chances of developing Alzheimer's but don't guarantee it. APOE-e4 is the most well-known risk gene, and it's estimated that 40-65% of Alzheimer's patients have it. Having one copy of APOE-e4 from either parent raises your risk, and having two copies increases the risk even more. APOE-e4 also tends to bring on symptoms at a younger age. Deterministic genes, on the other hand, directly cause Alzheimer's. If you inherit one of these genes, you will develop the disease. However, these genes are very rare and are responsible for only about 1% or less of Alzheimer's cases. They typically lead to early-onset Alzheimer's, with symptoms starting in a person's 40s to 50s. \"More than 100 genes are identified as 'At risk genes' for Alzheimerâ€™s disease. No point chasing them. One important defining fact about these genes is that though they put the person at risk but the person is unlikely to get the disease before 65 years of age,\" Dr. Shamsheer Dwivedee further said. \"A person who wants to reduce the risk of dementia in himself and his loved ones should focus on Healthy lifestyle rather than the genetics because 'At risk gene' effect can be negated with these habits which includes, heart Healthy diet (works for Alzheimerâ€™s prevention as well), good quality sleep, 4km of brisk walk daily and remaining mentally and socially active,\" he added. He also said that if in a person, Alzheimerâ€™s develops before 60 years of age there are more likelihood of the person carrying the 'definitive' or the dominant gene namely - APP (on chromosome 21), Presenelin 1 (on chromosome 14) and Presenelin 2 (on chromosome 1). If one is carrying these genes then there is a very high chance of getting AD. But these constitutes 0.2 to 0.5 percent of AD in various populations. There is always a family history and the decline in cognitive functions starts early. Why Is It Important To Understand These Genes? \"Understanding these genes is important because it helps us grasp the underlying biology of Alzheimer's, especially the role of a protein called beta-amyloid. It also informs genetic testing, which can identify APOE-e4 and rare deterministic genes. But it's crucial to note that routine genetic testing for Alzheimer's isn't widely recommended. Testing should come with counseling because the results can have profound effects on individuals and their families, including decisions about treatment and how they plan for the future,\"said Dr. Sajid Mairaj. One note of caution that before genetic testing a genetic counselling is advisable because partial information can cause unnecessary anxiety, fear and may lead to wrong choices in life. We do not have gene therapy for dementia. The good habits mentioned above is universally true for all types of dementia. So live Healthy and stops worrying. Â \n",

            "Text: World Patient Safety Day 2023: Things To Watch Out For Before Purchasing Medicines In an era where Health takes center stage, making informed decisions about our medications is crucial. Every medicine you find on the pharmacy shelf comes with a label that holds valuable information. Understanding these labels can be the key to your well-being and safety. According to The Institute of Medicine, lack of patient understanding and subsequent unintentional misuse of medicines is the root cause of medication error, poor adherence and worse Health outcomes.Â  In this regard, Dr. Sumitra Agarwal, who is the Director of Artificial Eye Co, Kolkata said, \"Decoding medicine labels is an essential step before purchasing any medication. The first thing to scrutinize is the active ingredient, ensuring it matches your therapeutic needs and avoiding duplication if you're on multiple medications. Also, examine the warnings and precautions to be aware of potential side effects and interactions. Additionally, safety seals are paramount; their integrity ensures the product hasn't been tampered with.\" Things To check Before Purchasing Medicines: Dr. Divya Singh, who is a Senior Surgeon at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, and Director of Maaiya Social Change Front Foundation listed down the things we should check before purchasing medicines: Active Ingredients: Know What You're Taking - The first and most critical information on any medicine label is the list of active ingredients. This section reveals the specific chemicals or compounds that make the medication work. Knowing the active ingredients is essential to avoid allergic reactions or interactions with other medications you may be taking. Dosage Instructions: Follow the Guidelines - Pay close attention to the dosage instructions provided on the label. It specifies how much medicine to take and how often. Following these guidelines is vital to ensure the medication's effectiveness and minimize the risk of side effects or overdosing. Expiration Date: Don't Use Outdated Medications - Always check the expiration date. Using medications past their expiration date can be ineffective or even harmful. Dispose of expired medications properly to ensure your safety. Usage Directions: Understand How to Take It - The label often includes usage directions, such as whether to take the medicine with food, water, or at a specific time of day. Comprehending these directions ensures that you get the maximum benefit from the medication. Warning and Precautions: Be Informed and Safe - Warnings and precautions provide vital information about potential side effects, special considerations, or situations where the medication should not be used. Read these carefully, especially if you have underlying Health conditions or are pregnant or breastfeeding. Storage Conditions: Keep Medications Safe - Proper storage conditions are crucial for maintaining the effectiveness of your medicines. The label may specify whether to store the medication at room temperature, in the refrigerator, or away from light and moisture. Over-the-Counter vs. Prescription: Understand the Difference - Distinguish between over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medications. Since OTC medicines can be purchased without a prescription, it requires responsible use and awareness to avoid drug misuse or overdose. Consult Your Healthcare Provider - Ultimately, the best way to decode medication labels is to consult your Healthcare provider or pharmacist. They can provide personalized guidance based on your medical history and ensure you make informed choices about your Healthcare. Things To Keep In Mind Before Buying Medicines For Children: Dr. Narayanaswamy, who is a pediatrician, founder and Medical Director at Athreya Hospital said, \"Concerned parents must be extra cautious while buying pediatric medicines\"Â  He also laid down the following guidelines: At first avoid over the counter drugs and preferably consult a Pediatrician before buying drugs for them: Don't treat kids as tiny adults. Always seek medical advice from a pediatrician or some medical expert before giving any medication to your child. Ensure that the medication is suitable for your child's age and weight as pediatric dosages can vary significantly. Read the medication labels carefully: Confirm that it matches the doctor's prescription and your child's details, including name, age & weight. When giving liquid medications, use the provided measuring device (commonly a measuring cup, syringe or dropper is provided ) rather than household spoons to ensure accurate dosing. Avoid pinch or fist as a measure. Reconstitute the medication within the bottle provided and avoid taking powder outside and mixing it. Avoid giving multiple medications (including other fields of medicine like ayurvedic, homeopathic etc) simultaneously without consulting your doctor as some drugs can cause drug interactions. Strictly follow the dosing instructions as provided by your doctor carefully. Never exceed the recommended dose, and always stick to the prescribed timing. Some medications come in various flavours or forms (e.g., chewable tablets, syrups). Choose a form that your child can take comfortably. Pay attention to the recommended storage conditions (e.g., store in a cool, dry place). This helps maintaining the medication's effectiveness. Also store medicines out of reach of children to prevent accidental ingestion. Allergies : Before buying drugs inform your doctor or pharmacist about any allergies your child has to medications or substances. Double-check that the medicine does not contain any allergens. Possible Side Effects: Be aware of potential side effects and adverse reactions to the medication. Contact your pediatrician immediately if your child experiences any unusual symptoms. On concluding, Dr. Vinodh Kumar S, who is an MBBS, MD (Internal Medicine) Consultant Physician & Diabetologist at Â Connect & Heal said, \"Being cautious when purchasing medicines is crucial for your Health as it can directly affect how you feel and how well you recover from an illness. To make sure you're on the right track, always check the name of the medicine carefully. Some medicines look or sound very similar to others, which can lead to confusion. Getting the wrong one can be harmful. Secondly, medicines that are close to expiring might not work either, so it's better to choose ones with a longer shelf life. Also, avoid buying medicines that have been banned or are known to be unsafe.\" \"Moreover, double-check that the dose matches what your doctor prescribed. It's essential to get the right amount. Avoid medicines with damaged packaging or broken seals, as they might not be safe to use. Never use medicine without a prescription from a Healthcare professional. They know what's best for your Health. Lastly, always save your prescription and receipts to keep track of your medicines and ensure your safety throughout your treatment,\" he added. Â \n",

            "Text: Zee-Sony Merger: After IDBI Bank, Axis Finance Challenges NCLT Order Allowing $10 Billion Deal Axis Finance has filed an appeal with the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), Delhi against the NCLT approval order of the merger between Zee Entertainment and Culver Max Entertainment (formerly Sony Pictures Networks India). The NCLT Mumbai bench granted approval to the merger scheme on August 10, rejecting objections from various lenders of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL), including IDBI Trusteeship, IDBI Bank, Axis Finance, JC Flowers Asset Reconstruction Co, and Imax Corp. This order has now been contested at the NCLAT. IDBI Bank has also approached the appellate tribunal to challenge the Mumbai bench's approval of the merger. \"The company has been served with an appeal on behalf of Axis Finance Limited against the company before the NCLAT, Delhi, challenging the order dated August 10, 2023 passed by NCLT, Mumbai Bench, dismissing the Interlocutory Application No. 124 of 2022 in CP (CAA) No. 209 of 2022 in CA (CAA) No. 204 of 2022 and approving the composite scheme of arrangement amongst Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited, Bangla Entertainment Private Limited and Culver Max Entertainment Private Limited (formerly Sony Pictures Networks India Private Limited),\" it said in a release. The $10 billion merger, originally announced in 2021, has faced many setbacks even after receiving approval from the National Stock Exchange, BSE, and regulators, such as the Competition Commission of India (CCI) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).Â  Also Read: Tata Motors Plans To Launch Exclusive Sales Network For EVs This Fiscal Year According to a report by the Economic Times, in August 2023, the Bombay High Court rejected a plea submitted by Axis Finance to involve Zee, Essel Mauritius, and Sony in its commercial summary lawsuit against Subhash Chandra Goenka, the promoter of ZEEL, and others. The lawsuit aimed to reclaim Rs 146 crore from Subhash Chandra Goenka.Meanwhile, SEBI has imposed a one-year ban on Zee's CEO, Punit Goenka and Chairman Subhash Chandra Goenka. Punit Goenka becoming the CEO of the merged entity was reportedly the key part of the merger scheme. In response, Zee has established an interim committee overseen by its board to manage operations. Punit Goenka expressed in June that the merger would proceed regardless of his role as CEO of the new entity. Earlier, in February, a tribunal halted insolvency proceedings initiated by IndusInd Bank Ltd against Zee, bringing significant relief to the media company. The company later resolved its dispute with the lender. To address regulatory concerns, Zee and Sony offered concessions like pricing discounts last year and obtained antitrust approval for the merged entity, positioning it as a competitor to Walt Disney India and Network18, owned by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, according to a Business Standard report.Â  Separately, IDBI Bank is involved in another matter against ZEEL, and the NCLAT has issued notice to the Entertainment firm led by the Subhash Chandra family. IDBI Bank challenged the NCLT's May 19 order, which had rejected a plea to initiate insolvency proceedings against the media major.\n",
