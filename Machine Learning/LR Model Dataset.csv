Worried About Rs 57 Lakh World Cup Tickets? Here's Good News From BCCI,"The Cricket World Cup craze has really caught on. The October 5 to November 19 mega event has seen great demand of tickets from cricket fans around the world. That the tournament will be played in India means that cricket fans in the country will get to witness some top-level thrilling cricket action. However, high demand of tickets have been such that many fans have been left high and dry. The India vs Pakistan match on October 14 at the Narendra Modi Stadium, naturally, generated the maximum interest. The primary ticket sales outlets for the match saw a complete sellout within only one hour on two specific dates: August 29 and September 3. On some reselling sites, however, the tickets were available but at a steep price. On Viagogo, an online sports ticket platform, a South Premium East 3 section ticket for the India vs Pakistan game was listed at Rs 21 lakh on Tuesday. Two tickets for the upper tier had a price of Rs 50 lakh each on the site on Tuesday. However, now the BCCI has stepped into action. ""The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) acknowledges the high demand for tickets for the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023,"" the cricket board said in a release on Wednesday. ""After discussions with the hosting state associations, the BCCI has announced the release of approximately 400,000 tickets for the highly anticipated tournament.

"Not Part Of 'Home WC' Squad, Ashwin's Message For India Is 'Special'","Veteran Indian cricket team spinner Ravichandran Ashwin was not included as skipper Rohit Sharma and chief selector Ajit Agarkar announced the squad for Cricket World Cup 2023 on Tuesday. India went with three spin options in Kuldeep Yadav , Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel . While Kuldeep was the only specialist spin bowling option, Axar and Jadeja are all-rounder options for the side. While Ashwin has been a mainstay for the side in Test cricket, he played his last ODI back in January 2022. After the squad announcement, Ashwin took to social media to post a special message for the Indian cricket team. ""Go well boys! Home World Cup is always special and let's ( all of us ) back them to bring it home,"" Ashwin posted on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). Go well boys! Home World Cup is always special and let's ( all of us ) back them to bring it home #ICCWorldCup2023 https://t.co/YUyvfXEQ3p The inclusion of wicketkeeper-batter KL Rahul , whose fitness was under scrutiny, headlined the announcement of India's 15-member World Cup squad on Tuesday, as the selectors strived for all-round balance. Chief selector Ajit Agarkar said there was no concern about Rahul's fitness, though he did not travel to Sri Lanka for India's group stage Asia Cup matches. Rahul is scheduled to reach Sri Lanka ahead of India's Super 4 matches, starting on September 9 against Pakistan. Agarkar said the 31-year-old managed to prove his fitness at the NCA on both batting and wicket keeping counts. The selectors also named Ishan Kishan as the second wicketkeeper-batter, and captain Rohit Sharma did not rule out the possibility of playing both Kishan and Rahul in the 11 if the situation warrants so. The selection of both Rahul and Kishan meant that there was no place for Sanju Samson , who is currently in Sri Lanka as a travelling reserve for the Asia Cup. Shreyas Iyer , who played against Pakistan in the Asia Cup, occupied one spot in the middle-order, and there was a two-way tie for the remaining position between Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma .

"Who Among Kumble, Dravid, Ashwin Not Engineer? KBC's Rs 12.5 Lakh Question","Anil Kumble and Rahul Dravid are two legends of Indian cricket. While Kumble has the most number of wickets among Indians in ODIs and Tests, Dravid's batting and , to some extent, his wicketkeeping has made him a ever-respected name in Indian cricket. Dravid is currently the head coach of the Indian cricket team. On the other hand, Krishnamachari Srikkanth was a prominent member of Indian cricket team's 1983 World Cup-winning team. Whereas Ravichandran Ashwin is among the leading wicket-takers among active cricketers. The reason for taking the name of these cricketer from different eras at one go is that they all made it to a question in popular show 'Kaun Banega Crorepati', hosted by Amitabh Bachchan, ""Which of these cricketers does not hold a degree in engineering?"" Anil Kumble, Rahul Dravid, Krishnamachari Srikkanth and Ravichandran Ashwin were the options. Several social media users pointed out that Dravid was the right answer. A question in KBC for 12,50,000 rs. pic.twitter.com/qYD8P1035c Indian cricket team coach Rahul Dravid, in his pre-departure press conference ahead of the Asia Cup, said that the team management had locked their number four and number five slot for the ODI World Cup almost 18 months ago but injuries to three batters in quick succession threw a spanner. Dravid said that injuries to the likes of Shreyas Iyer , KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant forced the team management to try out other players in the middle-order in recent times, and it was not experimenting just for the sake of it. ""The No 4 and 5 spots are discussed a lot and gives the impression that we didn't have clarity that who is going to be there. I could have told you 18-19 months ago who the three candidates for the two spots were,"" Coach Rahul Dravid said. ""It was always between Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant. There was not doubt,"" Dravid said at India's pre-departure presser ahead of the Asia Cup. ""It's unfortunate that all three had injuries in the space of two months. What are the odds of that happening. All three guys pushing for those two spots, had serious injuries, had to go under the knife. ""So, you have to react to that, put other people in those positions and see who can do it. Just in case come a World Cup they are not fit. In that situation we tried a few people."" The former Indian captain added, ""This word (experimentation) keeps getting thrown around without being thought through. It's not that we are experimenting for the sake of experimenting, sometimes there are specific reasons for it.""",sports

"Things task manager adds adjustable text size with responsive layout on iPhone, iPad, and Mac","Cultured Code is adding a highly requested feature to its task management app Things: adjustable text size. Starting with version 3.18, Things is specifically designed to react to a range of text sizes without compromising how information is presented. The new version of Things does this in part by replacing the app’s iconography with vector graphics that respond fluidly to changing display sizes. A common challenge, especially with large text sizes, is running into text truncation or having icons remain static in size. Cultured Code says it has fine-tuned the layout in Things “so that everything scales together beautifully.” Things 3.18 will automatically respond to your system text size on iPhone and iPad using Apple’s Dynamic Type feature. This can be adjusted in Settings ? Display & Brightness ? Text Size, or with the optional Dynamic Type adjustor in Control Center. You can also size the text up or down in Things independently from system text size from Things Settings ? Appearance. Dynamic Type hasn’t come to the Mac yet, but Cultured Code has made Things for macOS just as adjustable. Things 3.18 includes 14 different text display sizes in Things ? Settings ? General.

"iPhone 15 charging port change could slow down upgrade cycle, analyst warns","Apple is with the iPhone 15, and that could deter some customers from upgrading, according to UBS analyst David Vogt. Per of the analyst’s comments: “People aren’t going to upgrade for the sake of upgrading, because they’d have to change over their cables everywhere. Maybe that causes people to wait a little bit.” (WB also quotes Michael Gartenberg as saying “the iPhone 13 is going to be good enough” in the same post, although it’s not clear what year Mr. Gartenberg was quoted as saying this.) As for the iPhone 15, it’s true that Apple will replace its proprietary Lightning port with the industry standard USB-C port. Apple has used USB-C on other products as far back as 2015. Apple’s last port change occurred in 2012 with the iPhone 5. Top comment by Really? So the cable type change to USB-C is what would cause the phone not to sell as much? So the fact that each year, the physical form changes just enough for people to have to buy new cases, but a change to the charging port would keep people from buying the phone (whether a cable comes with it or not)? I know people who buy a case every time the wind changes directions, but you're saying they won't spend money for a charging cable? Sigh!! I would suspect most people with iPhones have other devices that use USB-C anyway. The most fascinating detail about the switch to USB-C on the iPhone 15 is that the decision is viewed as . Personally, I think that’s 98% accurate, but Apple would certainly fight it if, say, the port mandate called for VGA (or more practically, ). USB-C, on the other hand, is probably something the iPhone should have adopted already. Perhaps Apple would have preferred to transition Pro models to USB-C one year, then move the standard model to the port a year or two later. Some customers were asking for the port change since the iPhone 12 Pro, so the lack of flexibility here is still mostly on Apple. Nevertheless, if iPhone 15 upgrade rates are affected by hesitation to change chargers, Apple can thank the EU – even if the transition should have started before now. Whatever public reaction lies ahead, the dam will break in less than one week. Apple is holding its at 10 am PT/1 pm ET. iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro will be the topic at hand.

Apple’s most popular iPad shifted to this model in 2023,"In October 2022, Apple updated its tablet lineup with new iPad Pro models and the launch of the entry-level iPad 10 while leaving the iPad Air and mini unchanged. Now a new report from CIRP looks at the most popular iPad models with a shift happening over the last year. In its new report titled CIRP compares the share of sales of each iPad model between June 2022 and 2023. In 2022, CIRP’s data showed the as the most popular single tablet with 35% of sales with the iPad Air coming in second with 24%. Most popular iPad for 2023 Interestingly, in 2023, that’s flipped with the most popular iPad being the . It took 26% of sales, just edging out the 12.9-inch model, and the iPad Air dropped to third place with a 19% share. When looking at the combined share of iPad Pro sales, that’s remained unchanged at 51% from 2022 to 2023. Shift to more affordable iPads The overall trend is Apple customers opting for more affordable iPads as indicated by the shift from the large iPad Pro to the smaller 11-inch model. The iPad mini which is priced below both Pro models also gained market share over the last year. CIRP sees the shift in iPad sales as “a very good time” for Apple to refresh the tablet lineup. When will new iPads arrive? However, the most recent expectations are for new iPad Pro models to arrive in . It’s unclear if we could see new versions of the iPad mini and iPad Air sooner. The iPad mini first launched in September 2021 and the iPad Air 5 debuted in March 2022. In any case, CIRP suggests updated models could help Apple dial in the iPad lineup’s “value distinction” as more consumers want to spend less than $1,000 on the devices.",technology
UGREEN debuts new 300W Nexode 5-port USB-C GaN Charger [Deal],"UGREEN today is launching it most capable USB-C GaN charger to date. Arriving with 300W of power, the new UGREEN Nexode offering packs five ports and has far more powerful than any other GaN wall charger on the market. Plus, it debuts with a $70 off launch discount . The current market strategy for USB-C chargers has been a simple one – pack as much power into as small of a form-factor as possible. It’s a design philosophy that has been sweeping just about every manufacturer out there, with UGREEN often times leading the charge . That’s very much the case this time around, especially with its new 300W Nexode offering. We’ve seen most other form-factors released in the company’s lineup over the past year or so, with its 200W model debuting previously as the flagship. Now the company is ready to make the leap up to an even more capable range. Centered around not just one, but a pair of GaN II chips, the UGREEN Nexode 300W USB-C GaN Charger needs double the silicon in order power its four USB-C slots and single USB-A port. The charger can handle charigng three laptops at once, and also sports temperature detection to help avoid overheating. Having 300W of power to dish out amongst five different ports means that you truly can charge your entire kit in a way that really hasn’t been true before. Earlier this year, I took a hands-on look at Satechi’s 200W charger that paired some capable onboard power with the smarts to actually make sure your devices could take advantage of it. It was really the first time I’ve actually found these multi-device chargers to be a capable solution for every single use case, and now it looks like UGREEN is hoping to double down on that with an extra 100W of power. Here’s a break down of what the new UGREEN Nexode 300W charger can dish out: Those speeds are based on when only a single one of the ports is in use. Plugging in six accessories is still going to require a little planning, unlike Satechi’s model , but doing so lets you get even more out of the 5-port design. The top slot can still handle 100W of power, while the second and third USB-C ports get 65W and 45W respectively. The fourth USB-C output can still power up an iPhone at full speed with 30W of juice, while the 22.5W USB-A port rounds out the package for accessories and the like. Now available for purchase, the new UGREEN Nexode 300W charger arrives direct from the official UGREEN online storefront . It clocks in with a $269.99 MSRP , but is currently seeing a launch promotion to score you the brand’s latest charger for less. Applying the on-page coupon will take $70 off, dropping the price down to $199.79 . Add 9to5Toys to your Google News feed.

Apple buys 50-year-old record label to grow Apple Music Classical app,"Enlarge Apple reader comments 15 with Apple has acquired 50-year-old record label BIS Records, the Swedish company's founder, Robert von Bahr, announced Tuesday. The purchase of the classical music-focused label follows Apple's late March launch of the Apple Music Classical app. Apple's BIS purchase adds to the app, which in March Apple called the ""world's largest classical music catalogue"" with ""over"" 5 million tracks. Von Bahr said the record label will be incorporated into the Apple Music Classical app and Platoon. Apple bought Platoon , which identifies new talent and helps creators make, distribute, and market their content, in 2018. Von Bahr noted his just turning 80 as part of the decision to sell. He also pointed to his interest in Apple's support for spatial audio and in bringing ""classical music to new audiences all over the world."" Neither Apple nor BIS disclosed the price of the acquisition. However, von Bahr said that he and the rest of the BIS staff will be ""retained"" by Apple. Advertisement The acquisition is another step in Apple's efforts to target classical music as it seeks to differentiate its streaming platform. Classical music still represents a drop in the massive bucket of on-demand music streaming. Data from data analytics firm Luminate and cited by Billboard in March found that classical music represented 0.8 percent of on-demand streams in the US in 2022. However, the data firm also said in June that the classical music genre outpaced total US on-demand streaming growth in 2022 (13.4 percent year over year versus 12.2 percent year over year, respectively). Apple Music $11 per month Individual plan subscription after free trial at Apple (Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through affiliate programs .) Apple launched Apple Music Classical as a separate app from Apple Music on March 28. Building upon Apple's 2018 acquisition of Primephonic , Apple Music Classical allows various search parameters related to classical works, from song title and composer, to conductor and orchestra names, soloist performers, and more. Additional features include composer biographies and deep-dives on famous works. Since its release, Apple Music Classical has added support for devices running Android 9 Pie and later. Apple didn't respond to questions seeking clarification on how Apple Music Classical artists get paid and if it differs from payments for Apple Music artists. PCMag in March suggested that the classical music app pays per stream, as Apple Music does. However, that wouldn't benefit older classical works. With its BIS acquisition, Apple may gain insight into how to navigate the financial side of classical music.",technology
India Seeks More Natural Gas Amid Emergency Measures to End Blackouts,"India is seeking additional volumes of natural gas and has asked utilities to expedite the completion of power plant maintenance, as part of emergency steps to stop electricity outages, according to a government note seen by Reuters. The move follows the extension of an emergency law that forces power plants running on imported coal to maximise output, as record power demand in August due to unusually dry weather, and a sharp decline in hydro and wind energy output resulted in the country’s widest electricity shortage in 16 months. “States may ensure that all gas-based power plants with whom they have power purchase agreements must be brought into use, during high demand days and non-solar hours,"" the power ministry note dated Sept. 5 said. “All efforts to be made to bring back the units under forced outage as quickly as possible,"" it said, adding states should try to expedite the commissioning of new renewable and thermal power plants. The move could boost demand for natural gas, and push India to seek more LNG cargoes on the spot market. India’s LNG imports have fallen for three consecutive financial years ended March 2023, government data shows. “Additional arrangement for gas, for running gas-based stations, from GAIL with tenders for advanced procurement for a generation has been planned, during upcoming high power demand months,"" the ministry said. RAPID POWER DEMAND GROWTH India’s power demand has been growing rapidly after the pandemic, with strong economic growth boosting demand from factories and the summer heat increasing household consumption. Coal accounted for over 73% of India’s power generation during the year ended March 2023, while renewable energy sources including wind and solar makeup over 11% of total generation. Over half of about 25 GW of India’s gas-fired capacity is non-operational due to relatively high LNG prices. The share of gas-fired power in overall output has fallen from an average of over 3% in the last decade to less than 2% currently due to high LNG prices. Below-average rain during the annual monsoon that typically runs between June and September is expected to result in lower hydroelectricity output in the coming months and increase stress on overall supply, the ministry said. “The maximum hydro generation achieved this year has been less than 40 GW against 45 GW last year,"" the note said. While India’s power grid faced minimal shortages during the day due to abundant solar power generation and availability, supply fell short of demand during the night, the power ministry said in the note. “It is pertinent to mention that the entire onus of meeting non-solar hours demand falls upon coal-fired generation,"" the ministry said.",business
Bizarre!

Such arguments could not be accepted as the wrapper clearly provides the information to the buyers/consumers to purchase the product only based on the number of biscuits. The potential consumer would only see the wrapper to decide the purchase of the product as the product information available on the packing influences the consumer’s buying behavior and that the product information available on the wrapper or label plays a significant role in customer satisfaction,"" the order said. In the present case, the paramount allegation is only with regard to lesser number of biscuits. ""Thus we answer the point accordingly holding that the 1st opposite party being the manufacturer and marketer had committed unfair trade practice and deficiency in service in misleading the consumers and that the complainant had successfully proved the same by sufficient admissible evidence,"" it said. While Dillibabu sought to impose Rs 100 crore fine on the company and the store that sold it and Rs 10 crore as compensation for the alleged act of unfair trade practice and deficiency in service, it said the reliefs sought by the complainant were exorbitant. The 2nd opposite party being the shopkeeper had no role to play with respect to the reduction in the number of biscuits. ""Hence, complaint dismissed against him,"" it said. The consumer forum subsequently directed that Rs one lakh be given as compensation to Dillibabu by the company and another Rs 10,000 towards litigation expenses to be paid by him. In its defence, ITC submitted that there was no deficiency or defect in the 76-gram biscuit packs of Sunfeast Marie Light in terms of the quantity that the packs were required to maintain under law. Citing Legal Metrology Rules 2011, it contended that if a pre-packaged commodity has a declared net quantity between 50 gram to 100 gram, then a maximum permissible error in excess or in deficiency of 4.5 gram of the declared quantity was allowed on such items. As per the rules, a package that has a declared weight of 76 g was permitted to weigh between 71.5 g to 80.5 g, it said.",business
"4 Soldiers Killed In Attack In Northwest Pakistan, Banned Terror Outfit TTP Claims Responsibility","Taliban militants killed at least four Pakistani soldiers and injured seven in an attack at two border check-posts in the restive northwestern Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province's Chitral district on Wednesday, reported news agency PTI, citing army officials. According to the Inter Services Public Relations, the media wing of the army, two military posts located close to the Afghanistan border in Chitral district's Kalash area were attacked by a large group of terrorists that was heavily armed with modern weapons. Confirming the death, the army said the soldiers died ""fighting gallantly"" during the exchange and added that the area was being sanitised to eliminate any other terrorists. ""During the fire exchange, 12 terrorists were sent to hell, while a large number has been critically injured,"" read the statement release by the Pakistani army. ""Security forces of Pakistan are determined to eliminate the menace of terrorism and such sacrifices of our soldiers further strengthen our resolve. The brave people of Chitral also stand firmly with the security forces in not allowing the terrorists to ruin the peace of the area,” the ISPR further said. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); The responsibility of both the attacks, Ostai security check-post and Janjeerat Koh check-post in the Chitral district has been claimed by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a banned terrorist outfit. The attack on Ostai security check-post claimed the life of two soldiers, while two soldiers were killed and four others injured in the attack on the Janjereet check post, sources close to PTI said. All the injured soldiers were shifted to Chitral Scouts Hospital, while one, who was declared critical was airlifted to the Combined Military Hospitals in Peshawar. In order to help handle the situation better, four choppers also made emergency landing at the Chitral airport, according to PTI sources.

India that is Bharat: On a name game,"India and Bharat have both evoked the same emotions among patriots for decades, but these labels of pride have now been weaponised for narrow political ends. The Bharatiya Janata Party government at the Centre has decided to use Bharat instead of India in some official communication and documents , a practice that its representatives say will now expand. ‘India, that is Bharat,...’ is how the Constitution of India names the country, and the use of one or the other has been largely contextual all this while. The cultural echoes of Bharat have never been in doubt, and the current hype around it is more about a campaign to discard the use of India, as if both cannot exist in harmony. India, according to this telling, is a foreign imposition, and hence unsuitable for national dignity. Bharat, linked as it is to various ancient sources, goes beyond the geographical and cultural landscape that constitutes the modern republic of India. In that sense, both names are an outcome of India’s nation-building journey. Labouring to tease out the foreign from the native in the expanse of this nation that hosts a multitude of ethnic, linguistic, and genetic diversity and that has been formed as a result of millennia of migrations and cross-currents of human interactions serves no purpose other than creating new flashpoints in society. This farcical hubbub hoisted upon the country should have been allowed to dissipate and recede, but the knee-jerk reaction of the Opposition gave it the aura of a fundamental identity question before the nation. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has been asking for privileging the use of Bharat over India for long, but the Opposition bloc’s decision to label itself INDIA as an acronym also might have influenced the BJP’s hurry in the naming exercise. Far from demonstrating a nation’s strength and pride, the government’s name game undermines the confidence and soft power of the nation. Bharat has been part of popular culture, political and cultural idioms, and literature across many Indian languages. Similarly, India is also used by millions within and outside the country who yearn for its progress. It is possible that contexts and constituencies of these proper nouns might vary, but that is the very reason to desist from attempting to impose the use of one and edge out the other. Whether it is India or Bharat, the essence of the meaning that it conveys remains the same. The needless juxtaposition of the two names should not affect the bonding of the inhabitants in the pursuit of a misplaced cultural combat. Let India and Bharat coexist as they have always been.",business
Petulant intimidation: On the FIR against Editors’ Guild members,"The registration of a police case against editors representing the Editors Guild of India (EGI) and the belligerent remarks of the Manipur Chief Minister, N. Biren Singh, constitute a petulant and intimidatory response to a report released by a fact-finding committee of the EGI. The report’s focus was on media coverage of the ethnic conflict that broke out early in May , and its main conclusion was that there was one-sided coverage by journalists during the conflict, but it also contained observations and conclusions indicating that the State leadership was partisan during the conflict. In a welcome move, the Supreme Court of India has given interim protection from arrest to those named in the first information report (FIR). Mr. Singh has sought to justify the filing of an FIR under sections relating to promoting enmity between two communities and wounding religious feelings by claiming that the three-member panel’s report is one-sided and may provoke further violence. However, going beyond criticising the report, he said its authors were “anti-state, anti-national and anti-establishment” and claimed that he would not have permitted them to visit the State had he known their purpose. There is no justification for such intimidatory statements even if Mr. Singh is entitled to disagree with the report. And there can be no doubt that there is no need to prosecute anyone for seeking answers and ascertaining facts about a prolonged spell of violence and conflict. The Guild sent a team to ascertain facts in response to complaints that the media was playing a partisan role. There was also a complaint from the Indian Army too that the media coverage was “arousing passion and not letting sustainable peace come in”. Besides flagging one-sided coverage, the report also underscores that the Internet ban made matters worse and had a deleterious impact on journalism. It reveals a preference for self-censorship — so that the volatile situation was not inflamed further — and reliance on the State government for news. “This narrative under the N. Biren Singh dispensation became a narrow ethnic one playing up to the biases of the majority Meitei community,” it says. One may question whether such direct imputation of blame on the government’s leadership is needed in a report on media behaviour, but the conclusion also points to the possibility that in conflict situations, partisan or ineffective governance will be reflected in journalistic coverage too. On the wider political canvas, there appears to be no significant initiative to effect reconciliation between the two communities locked in conflict in Manipur and to bring about lasting peace. Meanwhile, it reflects poorly on the authorities if police cases are used to silence fact-finding initiatives of civil society.",business
Top ASUS routers have serious security flaws that could let hackers hijack your device,"Cybersecurity researchers discovered three major vulnerabilities in some high-end ASUS routers, which could be used to hijack endpoints, disrupt connectivity, and deploy malware and ransomware . The routers in question are ASUS RT-AX55, RT-AX56U_V2, and RT-AC86U - all high-end devices used by gamers and other individuals with high-performance demands. The vulnerabilities plaguing these devices are tracked as CVE-2023-39238, CVE-2023-39239, and CVE-2023-39240. They carry scores between 9.8 and 10.0, and affect firmware versions 3.0.0.4.386_50460, 3.0.0.4.386_50460, and 3.0.0.4_386_51529 respectively. In the meantime, ASUS has deployed a fix and urged its users to apply it immediately. Those using any of the three vulnerable routers should make sure they apply these firmware updates: RT-AX55: 3.0.0.4.386_51948 or later RT-AX56U_V2: 3.0.0.4.386_51948 or later RT-AC86U: 3.0.0.4.386_51915 or later Also, users are advised to turn off the remote administration feature (WAN Web Access), as that’s how hackers usually target these devices. ASUS has had a busy summer. In late June this year, the company was forced to push out a firmware update to address a number of high-severity flaws that were discovered. The firmware update addressed no fewer than nine CVEs, including three from 2023, five from 2022, and one dating back as far as 2018. A number of other vulnerabilities and issues were also fixed as part of the motion. In a statement, the company noted that, “If you choose not to install this new firmware version, we strongly recommend disabling services accessible from the WAN side to avoid potential unwanted intrusions,” which includes remote access from WAN, port forwarding, DDNS, VPN server, DMZ, port trigger. The routers in question included: GT6, GT-AXE16000, GT-AX11000 PRO, GT-AXE11000, GT-AX6000, GT-AX11000, GS-AX5400, GS-AX3000, XT9, XT8, XT8 V2, RT-AX86U PRO, RT-AX86U, RT-AX86S, RT-AX82U, RT-AX58U, RT-AX3000, TUF-AX6000, and TUF-AX5400.

YouTube's new games and UI changes might improve your video consumption life,"Even as YouTube cracks down on third-party apps and raises YouTube Premium prices , the video streaming and hosting site has been making plenty of changes to improve the user experience. Two more such changes are being tested out right now: adding playable games and updating its sharing menu for desktop and mobile. For the former, YouTube is adding a ‘Playables’ section to the site, with 9to5Google reporting that one of the games will be Stack Bounce . For now, it’s only coming to certain users, so make sure to search for ‘Playables’ in the content section to see if you’re one of the lucky few. The latter involves YouTube updating its sharing menu, moving it from a bottom-positioned share sheet to a floating option. According to Android Police , when your device is in landscape orientation, the floating bar is in the middle, while it remains at the bottom in portrait mode. It’s a quality-of-life change that improves navigation for many users, though currently, it’s only available to a handful of users. There are plenty of other UI changes and features being added to YouTube’s mobile and desktop versions. For instance, in July 2023 three features were added including a faster way to double playback speed, a Lock Screen for disabling all “touch input while watching a [full screen] video,” and bigger thumbnail previews. YouTube also revealed several other features in the works that all revolve around improving YouTube Music, whether it’s quality of life changes or changes that will have a noticeable impact on the music industry itself. Live lyrics , for instance, scrolls lyrics for you as a song progresses to make it easier to understand and to sing along to, and there's even a search function that lets you hum to find your favorite song . The biggest news by far, though, is YouTube’s Music AI Incubator , which will partner with music industry professionals to ensure artists and rights holders are properly compensated for AI music. This would potentially allow the site to keep its AI cash cow without infringing on artists’ intellectual properties. However, there are plenty of unpopular changes as well like the aforementioned crackdown on third-party apps and YouTube Premium prices shooting up. There’s also the divisive Shorts, which is both popular but currently hard to monetize , as well as the implementation of a ‘three-strikes’ policy against ad blockers . With all these changes to YouTube, it’ll be interesting to see how the site looks and functions even five years from now.",technology
Pakistan shuts key border crossing with Afghanistan after guards exchange fire,"Pakistani authorities closed a key border crossing with landlocked Afghanistan on September 6 shortly after border guards from the two sides exchanged fire, officials and residents said, in a sign of increasing tensions between the two neighbors. Reasons why the two sides exchanged fire were not immediately made clear, said Nasrullah Khan, an official in Torkham, a town in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. He said Pakistani government and military officials were in contact with their Afghan counterparts to defuse tensions. Abdul Mateen Qani, the Afghan Taliban-appointed spokesman for the Interior Ministry, confirmed the clash between Afghan and Pakistani forces. He said officials from both sides were attempting to find out what caused the clash and ways to prevent such incidents in the future. Pakistani authorities said dozens of trucks carrying perishable items, including vegetables and fruits, were waiting on both sides of the border for the reopening of the Torkham crossing, which is a vital commercial artery and trade route to Central Asian countries for Pakistan. The border closure comes two days after caretaker Pakistani Prime Minister Anwaar ul Haq Kakar said U.S. military equipment left behind during the American withdrawal from Afghanistan had fallen into militant hands and made its way to the Pakistani Taliban. The Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, have intensified attacks over the past months on Pakistan security forces. They are a separate group but an ally of the Afghan Taliban. The Afghan Taliban overran Afghanistan in August 2021 as U.S. and NATO troops were in the last weeks of a chaotic pullout from the country after 20 years of war. The Pakistani Taliban have released statements and video clips in recent months claiming they possess weapons such as guns with laser and thermal imaging systems. Torkham witnessed previous clashes in February and the town remained closed for several days after the two sides accused each other of trying to build new posts along the border in February. According to the Pakistan-Afghanistan Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the clashes at the time caused millions in losses to traders whose perishable goods were ruined. Afghanistan has never recognized the porous border that runs through the Pashtun heartland and dilutes the power of Afghanistan’s largest ethnic group on both sides. Pakistan says it has completed fencing along 97% of the border to stop cross-border attacks and smuggling. Pakistan also accuses the Afghan Taliban of providing sanctuaries to Pakistani militants who are living in Afghanistan. Also on Wednesday, a mortar hit a house near the Afghan border, killing five Pakistanis— a mother and her four children. It was not immediately clear who fired the mortar and police officers were still investigating, local authorities said. Currently, Pakistani security forces are carrying out intelligence-based operations against insurgency in the region. Militants often fire mortars to target security forces deployed in the region, and it has caused civilian casualties as well in recent years. In November 2022, the Pakistani Taliban ended a monthslong cease-fire with the government in Islamabad, ordering its fighters to resume attacks across the country.",world
"This summer was a global record breaker for the highest heat ever measured, meteorologists say","Earth has sweltered through its hottest Northern Hemisphere summer ever measured, with a record warm August capping a season of brutal and deadly temperatures , according to the World Meteorological Organization. Last month was not only the hottest August scientists ever recorded by far with modern equipment, it was also the second hottest month measured, behind only July 2023 , WMO and the European climate service Copernicus announced Wednesday. August was about 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial averages. That is the threshold that the world is trying not to pass, though scientists are more concerned about rises in temperatures over decades, not merely a blip over a month's time. Editorial | Mercury rising: On an ‘era of global boiling’ The world's oceans — more than 70% of the Earth's surface — were the hottest ever recorded, nearly 21 C (69.8 F), and have set high temperature marks for three consecutive months, the WMO and Copernicus said. “The dog days of summer are not just barking, they are biting,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement. “Climate breakdown has begun.” So far, 2023 is the second hottest year on record, behind 2016, according to Copernicus. Scientists blame ever warming human-caused climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas with an extra push from a natural El Nino, which is a temporary warming of parts of the Pacific Ocean that changes weather worldwide. Usually an El Nino, which started earlier this year, adds extra heat to global temperatures but more so in its second year. Climatologist Andrew Weaver said the numbers announced by WMO and Copernicus come as no surprise, bemoaning how governments have not appeared to take the issue of global warming seriously enough. He expressed concern that the public will just forget the issue when temperatures fall again. “It’s time for global leaders to start telling the truth,” said Weaver, a professor at the School of Earth and Ocean Sciences at the University of Victoria in Canada. “We will not limit warming to 1.5 C; we will not limit warming to 2.0 C. It’s all hands on deck now to prevent 3.0 C global warming — a level of warming that will wreak havoc worldwide.” Copernicus, a division of the European Union’s space program, has records going back to 1940, but in the United Kingdom and the United States, global records go back to the mid 1800s and those weather and science agencies are expected to soon report that the summer was a record-breaker. “What we are observing, not only new extremes but the persistence of these record-breaking conditions, and the impacts these have on both people and planet, are a clear consequence of the warming of the climate system,” Copernicus Climate Change Service Director Carlo Buontempo said. Scientists have used tree rings, ice cores and other proxies to estimate that temperatures are now warmer than they have been in about 120,000 years. The world has been warmer before, but that was prior to human civilization, seas were much higher and the poles were not icy. So far, daily September temperatures are higher than what has been recorded before for this time of year, according to the University of Maine's Climate Reanalyzer. While the world's air and oceans were setting records for heat, Antarctica continued to set records for low amounts of sea ice, the WMO said. ""Antarctic sea ice extent was literally off the charts, and the global sea surface temperature was once again at a new record,” WMO's secretary-general, Petteri Taalas, said in a statement released to the media. ""It is worth noting that this is happening BEFORE we see the full warming impact of the El Nino event, which typically plays out in the second year after it develops.” A strong El Nino coincided with the all-time high temperatures in 2016. The U.N. weather agency earlier this year rolled out predictions that suggest Earth would within the next five years have a year that averages 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than in the mid 19th century. Each year at or near 1.5 matters. It also predicted 98% chance of breaking the 2016 record between now and 2027. The new readings on high global temperatures came as WMO released Wednesday its latest bulletin on air quality and climate, noting that extreme heat, compounded by wildfires and desert dust, has had a measurable impact on air quality, human health and the environment. WMO scientific adviser Lorenzo Labrador lamented the deteriorating air quality around the globe and cited “record-breaking wildfire season” in many parts of the world, including western Canada and Europe. “If heat waves increase as a result of El Nino, we may probably expect a further degradation in air quality as a whole,” he said.",world
The Last Of Us At Halloween Horror Nights Captures Something The Games And TV Show Can't,"It's been a big year for The Last of Us. Not only did the original game finally come to PC in 2023, but we also got the beloved live-action adaptation on HBO . Still, even with The Last of Us occupying a big space in pop culture, Naughty Dog, the studio behind the game series, wasn't finished. There was one last frontier for The Last of Us to conquer: Halloween Horror Nights. Each year, Universal Studios in Orlando, FL and Los Angeles, CA present its celebration of horror with haunted mazes dotting both theme parks, often inspired by well-known franchises. This year, The Last of Us made the cut. Surprisingly, though, Universal didn't adapt the TV show.

According to Druckmann himself, speaking at a Halloween Horror Nights media event, it took less than 24 hours for someone from the parks to reach out and get the ball rolling. Now, fans on each coast can find themselves immersed in The Last of Us in a way the game and the TV show could never accomplish. ""There's something really special about this experience, but how do you articulate it? You want to put the players in the game,"" Druckmann told GameSpot. ""And you can argue, 'Well, they're already in the game. They're playing as Joel, they're turning the camera on. They're deciding what they're doing.' Yes, but they're seeing it through a 2D frame on their wall. And what if you break that frame and now they're surrounded by it, and you can walk, and you can touch it, and you can feel it, you could smell it. And it's a different kind of an emotional experience."" It's truly something the show or games can't accomplish, with guests able to touch the various environments and items throughout the maze, before finding themselves face-to-face with an infected person while the smell of something putrid lingers in the air. For Druckmann and the team at Universal Studios, though, it wasn't enough just to recreate the atmosphere of the games for guests to explore. There also needed to be familiar faces. ""Then [you must] add the Joel and Ellie experience and really feel like you're on a journey with them,"" he explained. ""It felt like you could give them something that they would draw from the game or draw from the show, but have a different kind of experience."" Of course, Druckmann also insisted one of his favorite things about having a maze at Halloween Horror Nights is the ""incredibly high production values, and it's here for this limited time, and then it's gone."" If you don't catch it at the parks on either coast this year, you'll never experience this take on The Last of Us again, which is certainly an interesting selling point for superfans. Another point of interest is that this isn't just a single maze that was made on both coasts. The experiences in Florida and California are different--something Universal Studios strives for when the parks take on similar intellectual property. Of course, Druckmann would only tease what the differences between the two mazes are, saying, ""There's some amazing stuff that's only here and some really amazing stuff that's only there."" Ultimately, though, either one should be a worthwhile destination if you love The Last of Us. Not only did the game's stars Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson record new dialogue just for Halloween Horror Nights, but Universal's creative team was given a treasure trove of assets by Naughty Dog, allowing the theme parks to recreate the sounds, sights, and feeling of the game. It allows Universal to create an immersive world where, while you know zombies aren't a thing and The Last of Us is a video game, it's easy to fall prey to infected shambling in the shadows or Ellie popping out from behind a wall, determined to protect you. And that's exactly what Druckmann and Naughty Dog wanted from the collaboration. ""For us at Naughty Dog, our approach is always: Let's do a few things and let's make sure they're the best. They're excellent,"" he said. ""So we've had people approach us to do similar experiences, but it wouldn't have been up to this level of quality."" Halloween Horror Nights runs on select nights through Halloween at Universal Orlando Resort and Universal Studios Hollywood.",entertainment
TurboTax-maker Intuit offers an AI agent that provides financial tips,"Enlarge Getty Images reader comments 40 with On Wednesday, TurboTax-maker Intuit launched an AI assistant called ""Intuit Assist"" that can provide AI-generated financial recommendations and assist with decision-making when using the company's software, Reuters reports .

Intuit Chief Data Officer Ashok Srivastava told Reuters that the company's AI models ""competed favorably"" against other AI systems in internal accuracy tests. Intuit Assist promotional video. Intuit's introduction of a generative AI feature is not surprising since AI has been the most buzzworthy tech subject this year—especially after the meteoric rise of ChatGPT . Much like public proclamations about experiments with blockchain technology in 2021, AI language models are seemingly being bolted into everything, whether it is appropriate or not. Advertisement That matters because accuracy is a major concern with all AI language models since the technology has a known propensity to confabulate (make up) information. However, Intuit isn't worried. ""We have a very, very robust testing mechanism that is AI-powered and it's also human-powered in order to analyze and calculate the accuracy of our models,"" Srivastava told Reuters. It's worth noting that Intuit Assist appears to be more than a fancy wrapper on a GPT-4 API , like other AI applications that have been springing up. The company states that Intuit Assist uses a platform called GenOS that is ""designed to run with our own financial large language models (LLMs) that are fine-tuned to solve tax, accounting, cash flow, personal finance, and marketing challenges.""

""As Attorneys General of our respective States and territories, we have a deep and grave concern for the safety of the children within our respective jurisdictions,"" the letter reads. ""And while Internet crimes against children are already being actively prosecuted, we are concerned that AI is creating a new frontier for abuse that makes such prosecution more difficult."" Further Reading Thousands of realistic but fake AI child sex images found online, report says In particular, open source image synthesis technologies such as Stable Diffusion allow the creation of AI-generated pornography with ease, and a large community has formed around tools and add-ons that enhance this ability. Since these AI models are openly available and often run locally, there are sometimes no guardrails preventing someone from creating sexualized images of children, and that has rung alarm bells among the nation's top prosecutors. (It's worth noting that Midjourney, DALL-E, and Adobe Firefly all have built-in filters that bar the creation of pornographic content.) ""Creating these images is easier than ever,"" the letter reads, ""as anyone can download the AI tools to their computer and create images by simply typing in a short description of what the user wants to see. And because many of these AI tools are 'open source,' the tools can be run in an unrestricted and unpoliced way."" As we have previously covered, it has also become relatively easy to create AI-generated deepfakes of people without their consent using social media photos. The attorneys general mention a similar concern, extending it to images of children: Advertisement ""AI tools can rapidly and easily create 'deepfakes' by studying real photographs of abused children to generate new images showing those children in sexual positions. This involves overlaying the face of one person on the body of another. Deepfakes can also be generated by overlaying photographs of otherwise unvictimized children on the internet with photographs of abused children to create new CSAM involving the previously unharmed children."" “Stoking the appetites of those who seek to sexualize children” When considering regulations about AI-generated images of children, an obvious question emerges: If the images are fake, has any harm been done? To that question, the attorneys general propose an answer, stating that these technologies pose a risk to children and their families regardless of whether real children were abused or not. They fear that the availability of even unrealistic AI-generated CSAM will ""support the growth of the child exploitation market by normalizing child abuse and stoking the appetites of those who seek to sexualize children."" Further Reading With Stable Diffusion, you may never believe what you see online again Regulating pornography in America has traditionally been a delicate balance of preserving free speech rights but also protecting vulnerable populations from harm. Regarding children, however, the scales of regulation tip toward far stronger restrictions due to a near-universal consensus about protecting kids. As the US Department of Justice writes , ""Images of child pornography are not protected under First Amendment rights, and are illegal contraband under federal law."" Indeed, as the Associated Press notes , it's rare for 54 politically diverse attorneys general to agree unanimously on anything. However, it's unclear what form of action Congress might take to prevent the creation of these kinds of images without restricting individual rights to use AI to generate legal images, an ability that may incidentally be affected by technological restrictions. Likewise, no government can undo the release of Stable Diffusion's AI models, which are already widely used. Still, the attorneys general have a few recommendations: Advertisement First, Congress should establish an expert commission to study the means and methods of AI that can be used to exploit children specifically and to propose solutions to deter and address such exploitation. This commission would operate on an ongoing basis due to the rapidly evolving nature of this technology to ensure an up-to-date understanding of the issue. While we are aware that several governmental offices and committees have been established to evaluate AI generally, a working group devoted specifically to the protection of children from AI is necessary to ensure the vulnerable among us are not forgotten. Second, after considering the expert commission’s recommendations, Congress should act to deter and address child exploitation, such as by expanding existing restrictions on CSAM to explicitly cover AI-generated CSAM. This will ensure prosecutors have the tools they need to protect our children. It's worth noting that some fictional depictions of CSAM are illegal in the United States (although it's a complex issue ), which may already cover "" obscene "" AI-generated materials. Further Reading AI image generation tech can now create life-wrecking deepfakes with ease Establishing a proper balance between the necessity of protecting children from exploitation and not unduly hamstringing a rapidly unfolding tech field (or impinging on individual rights) may be difficult in practice, which is likely why the attorneys general recommend the creation of a commission to study any potential regulation. In the past, some well-intentioned battles against CSAM in technology have included controversial side effects , opening doors for potential overreach that could affect the privacy and rights of law-abiding people. Additionally, even though CSAM is a very real and abhorrent problem, the universal appeal of protecting kids has also been used as a rhetorical shield by advocates of censorship. AI has arguably been the most controversial tech topic of 2023, and using evocative language that paints a picture of rapidly advancing, impending doom has been the style of the day. Similarly, the letter's authors use a dramatic call to action to convey the depth of their concern: ""We are engaged in a race against time to protect the children of our country from the dangers of AI. Indeed, the proverbial walls of the city have already been breached. Now is the time to act.""",technology
Vivek Ramaswamy Says Will Pardon Jan 6 Protesters If Elected US President,"Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy has vowed that he will pardon all peaceful January 6 protesters if he gets elected as the next US president in 2024. The 38-year-old Indian American entrepreneur has gained traction after he denounced the US Justice Department for its ""political persecution"" of non-violent protesters at the Republican primary presidential debate last month. “America now has a two-tiered justice system: Antifa and BLM rioters roam free while peaceful January 6 protesters are imprisoned without bail. Biden's ‘Department of Injustice' has executed over 1,000 arrests for nonviolent offenses related to January 6, casting a dark shadow over Lady Justice and the foundational principles of our legal system,” he said in a statement. “To unify this country, I commit as president to pardon all Americans who were targets of politicised federal prosecutions and those denied due process. This includes all peaceful, nonviolent January 6 protesters who were denied their constitutional due process rights,"" he said on Wednesday. The January 6 riot saw more than 2,000 people enter the US Capitol as lawmakers certified the results of the 2020 election, in which President Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump. The mob stormed the Capitol following a speech from Trump, who was speaking at a rally not far from the Capitol grounds. In his speech, Trump claimed election fraud and called on then-Vice-President Mike Pence to overturn the results. The riot led to the biggest police investigation in US history with hundreds of people accused of criminal offences. Ramaswamy said he will end the weaponisation of police power in America and noted that every Republican candidate must be clear on hard issues. He said on Sunday that while he expects to become the party's nominee for the November 2024 US elections, he will vote for Trump if the former president secures the nomination. He also expressed his intention to pardon Trump, who currently faces an array of legal challenges, should he be elected as President of the United States. “If Donald Trump's the nominee -- yes, I will support him, and if I'm the president, yes, I will pardon him because that will help reunite the country. But it's not the most important thing I'm going to do as the next president. It is the table stakes for moving this country forward,” Ramaswamy told ABC news. Following his impressive performance in the inaugural Republican primary presidential debate last month, Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur-turned-politician, has experienced a surge in popularity, competing alongside fellow Indian American rival Nikki Haley, the former Governor of South Carolina. Meanwhile, several media outlets reported that Ramaswamy escaped unhurt when a sign reading “Truth” fell on him during a campaign event in New Hampshire over the weekend. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com An opinion poll shared by the Trump Campaign showed that Ramaswamy (with 15 per cent) is now a distant second after former president Trump (68 per cent). Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is now at 13 per cent and at the third position. (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",world
Suspect In Bomb Attack On Japan PM Indicted For Attempted Murder,"The bomb used in the attack was lethal. A 24-year-old man has been formally indicted by Japanese prosecutors for attempted murder and other charges in the explosives attack on Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in April, Fox News reported. The indictment comes after Ryuji Kimura underwent a three-month psychiatric evaluation and prosecutors ultimately determined that he is mentally fit for trial, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported. It was also determined that the bomb used in the attack was lethal. The assassination attempt happened in April this year when Ryuji Kimura allegedly threw a pipe bomb at Mr Kishida, as he was campaigning in the fishing port of Saikazaki, in the western Japanese city of Wakayama. Footage from national broadcaster NHK showed the prime minister turning to look backwards as a person was detained by security and people moved away, some shrieking. Seconds later, a blast was heard and white smoke filled the air. The PM was unhurt, but two people received minor injuries. Kyodo reported that court records show Kimura may have been angry because he couldn't file for candidacy in 2022 elections. Investigators found he purchased explosives used to make the bomb in November 2022, around the time he lost his lawsuit against the government over the election system. Prosecutors have now formally indicted Kimura on an attempted murder charge and four others, including violation of the gun and swords control law and the explosives control law, according to the Wakayama District Court. “The attack that put at risk not only Prime Minister Kishida but also the audience during an election that forms the basis of democracy is absolutely unforgivable,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said after the indictment Wednesday. The incident in Wakayama came less than a year after the assassination of former prime minister Shinzo Abe, which traumatised the country and forced a security shake-up for public officials.

Mitchell Starc Planning to Make IPL Comeback in 2024 as Part of His Preparation for ICC T20 World Cup,"Australian quick Mitchell Starc will be returning to the Indian Premier League (IPL) next year, for the first time since 2015, in order to prepare for the ICC T20 World Cup, which will take place in West Indies and June next year. If he is picked up by a team this will be his second franchise. He had played in two seasons in 2014 and 2015 for Royal Challengers Bangalore, picking up 34 wickets in 27 matches. Back in 2018, he was acquired by Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) before he withdrew due to injury and on other occasions, he prioritised international cricket over IPL. Harry Brook Remains in Contention for a Spot in England’s ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 Squad After His Inclusion in ODI Series Against New Zealand . However, the next year is comparatively light for Australia. There is a T20 World Cup scheduled between a tour of New Zealand in March and a white-ball series against Afghanistan, Ireland and England from late August. ""Look it's been eight years. I'm definitely going back in [next] year,"" Starc told the Willow Talk Cricket Podcast about his IPL ambitions as quoted by ESPNCricinfo. ""Amongst other things, it's a great lead-up to the T20 World Cup,"" he added. ""So a good opportunity to see if anyone's interested in the IPL, then lead into the T20 World Cup. And it is somewhat of a quiet winter next year…in comparison to this winter, so I think a perfect opportunity to put my name in,"" he concluded. One of the major reasons why he has not played IPL for so long is that he wants to stay available for Test cricket. He would like to reach a century of matches in format, something which pacer Glenn McGrath has done in the past and remains the only pacer in Australia to do so. He currently has played 82 Tests and if he manages to play Australia's upcoming fixtures of the Future Tours Programme, his 100th match will be during the 2025-26 Ashes. ""Not just get to 100, I would like to be good enough to be picked for 100 Tests. And then the big one obviously in a couple of weeks is the World Cup, which in India just goes to another level,"" he said. ""And then you look at the one-day format, it is sort of four years in between World Cups, so where do I see myself in that mix? But I have got to get to the end of this World Cup first."" ""But we have got some superstars coming through. You have got your Jhye Richardsons, your Sean Abbotts, your Spencer Johnsons. You have got plenty of young guys coming through. [Lance] Morris is going to be a gun."" Fans, Supporters Warmly Welcome Nepal Cricket Team Following Their Asia Cup 2023 Campaign . ""I try not to look too far ahead with anything. Obviously, we want to do well in the World Cup. Then we have got five Test matches here in Australia and then I haven't actually played a Test in New Zealand, so hopefully I am on that tour and look forward to that challenge as well,"" he concluded.

"G20 Summit 2023: Green Financing, Energy Transition — Key Climate Issues In Focus","G20 Summit 2023: The 18th G20 (Group of Twenty) Summit will be held in New Delhi from September 9 to 10, 2023, and will focus on key climate issues. India currently holds the G20 Presidency. The G20 theme this year is ""Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam"" or ""One Earth • One Family • One Future"", and has focused on the concept of 'Lifestyle for Environment' (LiFE). While the agenda emphasises climate change, geopolitical tensions due to the Russia-Ukraine War, the US-China rivalry, and China President Xi Jinping and Russia President Vladimir Putin deciding to skip the G20 summit may serve as hindrances to attaining a unified agreement on important climate issues such as energy transition, sustainable development goals, and green financing. The year 2023 is the second warmest on record so far, and August 2023 is the second hottest month ever. Also, the boreal summer 2023 is the warmest Northern Hemisphere summer since 1940. Sea surface temperatures have reached record high levels. If these patterns continue, the year 2023 will soon become the hottest on record. These extreme weather events call for more stringent climate policies. At the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) to be held in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) later this year, major economies will be urged to implement plans to ensure that fossil fuel phaseout is accelerated, renewables are tripled, and new levels of climate finance are raised.

Here's How googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); Despite the fact that India's G20 Presidency has improved the global status of the country, the absence of Xi and Putin may cloud the success of the Summit. The Summit is a conclusion of all the G20 meetings that have occurred throughout the year, and at the end, a declaration will be adopted. At the environment and climate ministers' meetings, ministers or their deputies from different nations agreed to unanimously commit themselves to creating a sustainable and resilient future, and focused on areas such as land degradation, blue economy, circular economy, biodiversity loss, and water resource management. However, all these meetings issued summary documents, and not an official announcement. This is because the leaders did not reach a consensus due to a lack of clarity of important issues like climate finance, energy transition, and phaseout of fossil fuels, among others.

The following are the key climate issues in focus. Green finance Financial resources or instruments intended to support climate action, protect the environment, and ensure sustainable development activities are referred to as green finance or climate finance. Green finance is important because it not only helps address climate change, but will also allow a country to make the investments needed to transition to a low-carbon global economy. Green financing can be done in the form of grants and donations, loans, and green bonds, which are debt securities designed to support environmentally-friendly activities. Green financing helps in mitigation, climate change adaptation, and resilience-building. MUST READ (EXCLUSIVE) | Water Scarcity, Sea Level Rise, Intensified Floods, Droughts, Heat Waves – Climate Threats For India At the 2023 G20 Summit, wealthier nations can donate trillions in investments to support developing countries to carry out energy transition. According to COP28's letter to the Parties, annual investments in climate action must be increased by more than $2.4 trillion annually by 2030. This accounts for two per cent of the global GDP. On September 5, the G20 finance deputies discussed debt distress (a situation where a country is unable to fulfil its financial obligations and its debt needs to be restructured) of vulnerable nations. India expects to be a part of discussions on debt distress at COP28. US President Joe Biden will attend the G20 Summit, and discuss a range of collective efforts to tackle global issues such as clean energy transition and combating climate change, mitigating the economic and social impacts of Russia's War in Ukraine, and increasing the capacity of the multilateral development banks, including the World Bank, to fight poverty, according to the White House.

According to a Reuters report, the European Union (EU) will seek a deal at COP28 to phase out fossil fuels. A report by the International Institute for Sustainable Development said that public financial flows to fossil fuels in G20 countries reached a record $1.4 trillion in 2022. In India, fossil fuel subsidies have declined by 76 per cent between 2014 and 2022. However, fossil fuel subsidies in India are more than four times the subsidies for renewables and electric vehicles.

Despite this, the G20 meetings held so far have not discussed the issue of coal. Therefore, an agreement at the Summit on coal phasedown is extremely important. In 2015, coal power accounted for 43 per cent of G20 electricity. This was reduced to 39 per cent in 2022. At the 2022 G20 Summit held in Bali, an agreement was signed to phasedown coal. Therefore, India hopes to persuade the Heads of State and Government to commit to phasing down fossil fuels, including coal. It is important that this unified agreement makes it to the final text. The per capita coal power emissions of several G20 Nations have increased. This can be reversed only through a coal phase down.

"Shaheen ""Dimaag Mein Baith Gaya Hai"": Pakistan Great On Rohit's Struggles","Former Pakistan pacer Shoaib Akhtar feels that Shaheen Shah Afridi has conquered the mind of India batter Rohit Sharma . When India and Pakistan faced each other in an Asia Cup 2023 game last week, Shaheen cleaned up Rohit with a ripper. It was a fuller delivery from the left-arm pacer that swung into the India captain and went through the defence to rattle his stumps at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium. Rohit was dismissed for 11 runs off 22 balls. "" Yeh Rohit Sharma woh Rohit Sharma hai hi nahi. Yeh uska stunt double hai. Shaheen uske dimaag mein baith gaya hai . (This is not the same Rohit Sharma. This one's a stunt double. Shaheen has conquered his mind). I have never seen him change his stance, but what was happening there? Stance change kara, beat hua, bowled hua (He changed his stance and got bowled). Shaheen is subconsciously in his mind. This is what pressure of India vs Pakistan match does to players,"" Akhtar said during a virtual press conference organised by Star Sports. The former Pakistan pacer earlier said that Rohit is unable to read or understand the bowling of star pacer Shaheen. ""I think Rohit is unable to read or understand Shaheen. The visual of Rohit Sharma being beaten like this was not good, but he is a far better player than this. Rohit can bat much better than this. I think he is worrying too much,"" Akhtar had said on his YouTube channel. India were bundled out for 266 runs despite fifties from Hardik Pandya (87) and Ishan Kishan (82). Rain interrupted the game more than a couple of times before it was eventually called off. ""The constant interruptions by rain, leading to the players going off the ground and coming back in, it affects the focus of the batters. Gill lost his wicket because of this reason, he lost his concentration, and that is why he played such a loose shot,"" said Akhtar. Gill, who barely looked set at the crease, was dismissed for 10 runs off 32 balls on the bowling of Haris Rauf . India and Pakistan will be facing each other next on September 10. It will be a Super 4 match at R Premadasa Stadium, Colombo. India will then be playing against Sri Lanka on September 12 while their last Super 4 match will be against Bangladesh on September 15.

National Nutrition Week 2023: Impact Of Processed Food On Health,"Food items are processed so that they are available throughout the year in all seasons and at all stores. Processed foods are pre-cut vegetables and meat, as per quality checks, making it easy for people to finish their cooking as early as possible. Each has an expiration date mentioned on it for consumption. Fresh food is always preferred, as processing reduces the nutrient content and may even strip away antioxidants and vitamins like vitamin C, which are volatile in nature. Talking about this, Rutu Dhodapkar, who is a member of the Dietetics Team at P D Hinduja Hospital and Medical Research Centre, Khar, "" Processed foods are not just microwave-based ready meals; they are processed to increase their shelf life and taste. They are made in such a way that they can be used for 6 months and above (the date of expiry is mentioned on them). Additives such as emulsifiers and preservatives are added to maintain the texture of foods, such as peanut butter, by preventing it from separating into solid and liquid parts."" ""Heavily processed foods often include unhealthy levels of added sugar, sodium, and fat. These ingredients taste better when added, but extra consumption of them leads to serious health issues like obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes lacking in nutritional value,"" she further went on to say. Rutu Dhodapkar also added, ""Researchers have mentioned that depression rates are 80% higher for those who eat ultra-processed foods. This includes chocolates, crips, biscuits, ice cream, and ready meals. Instant noodles are unhealthy as they are very high in sodium, low in fibre, and contain MSG (monosodium glutamate), which helps enhance flavour and give taste to the palate. The amount of MSG added is approved by the FDA; concerns regarding its use, whether short-term or long-term, accordingly affect your body."" googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); Some Common Processed Food Items That Affect Our Health: Dr. Manisha Choudhary, who is a Consultant – Dietitian & Nutritionist at Motherhood Hospital, Noida said, ""Processed foods often contain a lot of calories but not many nutrients. Eating too much of them can lead to a lack of important vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that are necessary for good health. The fast digestion of refined sugars and carbs in these foods can cause sudden increases in blood sugar, which can lead to problems like insulin resistance and diabetes."" ""Moreover, excessive amounts of unhealthy trans fats and saturated fats are prevalent in processed foods. These can increase the risk of heart disease by blocking arteries and causing inflammation,"" she further added. Additionally, Mami Beheruk, who is the HOD of Dietitics at Sahyadri Super speciality hospital, Hadapsar, Pune, shared s ome of the common processed foods in our daily life which affects our health severely. Carbonated Drinks - Carbonated drink contain sodium benzoate as preservative and aspartame, sucralose & saccharine as artificial sweeteners. Though the mentioned sweeteners are safe to consume in moderation but sodium benzoate is a harmful content and affects health severely. When sodium benzoate is combined with food high in vitamin C, it can also be converted into a benzene, a compound that may be associated with cancer development. Apart from Carbonated drinks, Sodium benzoate is a preservative often added to acidic foods like salad dressings, pickles, fruit juices and condiments. Processed Meat - To increase the shelf life of meat, Sodium Nitrite is added as preservative. It prevents the growth of bacteria while also adding a salty flavour and reddish-pink colour. Sodium nitrite is a common ingredient in processed meats that can be converted into a harmful compound called nitrosamine. A higher intake of processed meats may be linked to a higher risk of several types of cancer. Packaged Juice/Candy/Breakfast Cereals - High-fructose corn syrup is used as sweetener in Packaged Juice/Candy/Breakfast Cereals & Food Snacks. It’s rich in simple sugar called fructose, which can cause serious health issues when consumed in high amounts. High-fructose corn syrup is associated with weight gain, diabetes and inflammation. It’s also high in empty calories and contributes nothing but calories to your diet. Processed Dairy Products - To thicken the Milk/Curd and other Dairy Producst, Carrageenan is added. Derived from red seaweed, carrageenan acts as a thickener, emulsifier and preservative in many different food products. Commonly used in almond milk, cottage cheese, ice cream, coffee creamers and dairy-free products like vegan cheese. It increases the levels of fasting blood sugar and glucose intolerance, especially when combined with a high-fat diet. Bakery Products & Pizza - For better shelf life, Trans fats is added in bakery products & pizza. Trans Fats are a type of unsaturated fat that have undergone hydrogenation, which increases shelf life and improves the consistency of products. Eating Trans fats has been associated with many negative effects on health, including inflammation, heart disease and diabetes. Frozen Food - Monosodium glutamate is a common food additive used to intensify and enhance the flavour of the product. It’s found in a variety of processed foods like frozen dinners, salty snacks and canned soups. It’s also often added to foods at restaurants and fast food places. MSG consumption is associated with weight gain and metabolic syndrome Apart from above major food items which poses serious health issues, there are ingredients used to improve the aesthetic or taste of food. Following are the ingredients shared by Mami Beheruk: Artificial Food Colouring - Artificial food colouring is used to brighten and improve the appearance of everything from candies to condiments. In recent years, though, there have been many concerns about potential health effects . Specific food dyes like Blue 1, Red 40, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 have been associated with allergic reactions in some people. Artificial food colouring may promote hyperactivity in children Artificial Flavouring - Artificial flavours are chemicals designed to mimic the taste of other ingredients. They can be used to imitate a variety of different flavours, from popcorn and caramel to fruit and beyond. More consumption artificial flavouring decreases the red blood production. How We Can Avoid Processed Food: One way to stop your intake of processed foods is to get back to cooking at home. That means using whole foods, such as vegetables, fruits, wholw grains, beans, fish and other nutrients. Here are some strategies for avoiding processed food: Hydrate with water: Aerated beverages; such as soda, sweetened tea and packed fruit juice are loaded with empty calories. Instead, quench your thirst with water, homemade buttermilk, lemon water. Make smart food swaps: We can replace highly processed foods with healthy substitutes. For example, if you're craving for the of chips, instead of that make your own banana chips by lightly seasoning with salt and pepper then put it into air fryer or in the oven. If you feel tempted to eat ice cream, satisfy your sweet tooth by freezing ripe bananas and blending them to make your own homemade healthy smoothie serve Meal preparation: If you're too busy to cook, you can avoid giving in to the convenience of eating fast food meals by planning ahead of time and preparing your meals at home for the week. To help, there are plenty of meal delivery services that can ship all the pre-portioned ingredients for you to make homemade meals. Step away from the frozen product: The frozen meats section is full of cold cuts, sausages and other processed meats. Instead, fill your shopping bag/cart with protein from the grocery store's meat and seafood where you'll find smart alternatives, such as chicken, salmon and prawns. For plant-based proteins, tofu, paneer chickpeas. We need to move away from eating processed foods and focus on eating whole, unprocessed foods instead. Eating fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats can give our bodies the essential nutrients it needs, while also reducing the amount of bad stuff like additives and too much sugar. As people who buy food, it's important to read labels, make good choices, and push for changes in the food system in order to take back our health from processed foods.” Indian Superfoods That Can Be Consumed Instead: Our rich culinary heritage, when combined with informed choices, can pave the way for optimal health. This National Nutrition Week, let's harness the power of local, nutrient-dense foods, grounding our lives in better health and improved quality of life. In this regard, Dr Neeta Deshpande, who is the Chief Medical Officer at Elevate Now, highlighted the nutrients present in Indian superfoods: Imported Superfoods vs Local Legends: The allure of imported superfoods like berries and avocados is undeniable. However, while we keep hearing about the antioxidant properties of blueberries, little do people know that our local fruits like jamuns and guavas are even higher in nutritional value. Similarly, while quinoa is a superfood that’s been celebrated in recent years, Amaranth is a local ingredient that offers significantly higher proportions of protein, iron, magnesium, and potassium, at roughly half the cost! The Carbohydrate Conundrum : The STARCH study (2014) in India found that the evaluated Indian population derived 64.1% of their energy from carbohydrates, notably above the maximum recommended limit of 60%. In a related finding, the ICMR-INDIAB national study indicated that by reducing daily carbohydrate intake by 15%, approximately 66% of participants experienced diabetes remission. However, when adjusting one's diet based on these findings, it's crucial to recognize that all carbs are not the same. While processed foods surge blood sugar levels due to their easily absorbable carbs, fiber-rich carbs from whole grains, beans, vegetables, and fruits are crucial for regulating blood sugar, cholesterol, and ensuring healthy digestion. These fiber-rich carbs have been consistently linked to healthier, longer lives. Fats: The Villain or the Hero? Fats, often viewed through a singular lens, are multifaceted in their roles. Trans fats, most found in processed foods, are detrimental to health, increasing the risk of heart disease, insulin resistance, and elevated cholesterol levels. Saturated fats occur in a wide variety of foods and should be consumed in moderation, since these are also linked to increasing the LDL or the bad cholesterol levels. However, a balanced diet must include a good amount of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats which are found in nuts, eggs, cheese, yoghurt, olive oil, groundnut oil and fatty fish. The Vegetarian Protein Puzzle: Contrary to the widespread belief, India's vegetarian cuisine isn’t protein deficient. For instance, a cup of whole lentils contains about 18 grams of protein, nearly equivalent to the protein in 100 grams of chicken. Plus, legumes like chickpeas and kidney beans are both protein-rich and high in fiber. Including other protein rich sources like soya chunks, paneer, black chanas, and peanuts can be a great way of ensuring a well-balanced vegetarian diet. However, if one is on a low calorie vegetarian diet, then protein supplements may be required to meet daily dietary requirements. Modern Lifestyles & The Vitamin Challenge : Though modern lifestyles pose unique challenges, it's a fallacy that they invariably lead to vitamin deficiencies. Millets, like the iron-rich foxtail or calcium-laden ragi, have long been India's silent health guardians. And how can we forget the humble spinach, a Vitamin K powerhouse, or bananas, those potassium-packed wonders? A skilled healthcare professional can help with personalising some of these choices to your specific health conditions – for example, in patients living with diabetes and obesity, one also must think about the glycemic index of these foods and consume them in moderation.",entertainment

Asia Cup 2023: What did Indian batsmen do at nets to prepare for Shaheen Afridi?,"Two men were the focus of attention of India’s batsmen at the indoor nets in Colombo on Thursday: the Sri Lankan Nuwan Seneviratne, the team’s throwdown specialist, and Hari Prasad Mohan, the data analyst. Ahead of the Pakistan game, India had turned to address the most obvious weakness choking them: the left-armer Shaheen Afridi’s atomic curlers. Seneviratne had the ball-slinging tool to curve in the inswingers and away-shapers, and Hari was faithfully recording the Indian batsmen’s technique on his tab, in particular their feet movement. Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli had opted out of the optional nets at Gamini Dissanayaka Indoor facility at the Nondescript Cricket Club, but the others sweated out physically and mentally on a rainy day. Once their focus on Seneviratne ended after their stint, Shubman Gill; Shreyas Iyer ; KL Rahul , in for his first training session with the team since recovering from injury, and the rest would hunch over to deep-dive into the videos. Was the front feet coming too far across or stuck too back and hence playing away from the body – and such concerns that has been plaguing India, not just against Shaheen but across left-arm swingers around the world. READ | Asia Cup prey to India-Pak spat, poor choice of venues Maybe it was a conscious decision to not make it a huge deal which can add to the pressure, head coach Rahul Dravid and batting coach Vikram Rathour both stayed away from keeping a close eye on how the batsmen were fairing against the Seneviratne, and instead giving throwdowns in adjacent nets. Gill, who struggled against the seam movement in his first outing against Pakistan, is known to have minimal footwork which isn’t ideal against left-arm pacers, was trying his best to course correct. On Thursday, at the nets, he ensured his feet moved towards the ball rather than sideways on a 90 degree angle at the crease as is his wont. If the lengths were fuller for Gill and Shreyas, with Rahul it varied a bit. Earmarked to bat in the middle-order at No 5, it is a phase where the left-arm pacers tend to operate around the stumps and cramp them for room. And Rahul, who is likely to wait for his turn as Ishan Kishan seems to be the favoured one to play against Pakistan on Sunday, even asked Seneviratne to deliver a few from a short distance, an indication of him wanting to get used to the extra-yard of pace. Not that they need any reminders, but on their mobile dashboards, which is where all the data (their own and opposition) are shared, they can easily expect plenty of video tutorials in the coming days on how to deal with each of these bowlers or where they failed with stats to back it up. India may not be deep diving into data like England or closer home in the IPL like Mumbai Indians , but still rely on any information or data that comes their way, rather than just brushing it aside. Having troubled India earlier in the T20 Asia Cup and T20 World Cup, Shaheen Shah Afridi once again caused all sorts of problems for India’s top-order in Pallekele. Come World Cup, apart from Afridi, India will face Trent Boult (NZ), Mitchell Starc (Australia), Reece Topley, David Willey (England), Marco Jansen (SA), Mustafizur Rahim (Bangladesh) and all of them capable of bringing the ball back into the right-hander.

It’s almost as if he says, ‘this is my plan: slip in a couple that go away perhaps but attack with the inswingers – stop me if you can’. And the effect has been startling. Batsmen’s feet have frozen in recent times after trampling too far across in the past and the ball has invariably pinged the pad or the stumps.

"Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep Singh are two people missing in this WC team: Harbhajan Singh","Indian duo of Yuzvendra Chahal and Arshdeep Singh should have been picked in the 15-member squad for the upcoming ODI World Cup, said former Indian offspinner Harbhajan Singh on Thursday. Chahal and Arshdeep were overlooked from the Indian squad, which was announced by the Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee on Tuesday. “I think there are two people missing in this team. First, Yuzvendra Chahal , and second, Arshdeep Singh. Because a left-arm seamer, if he can bring the new ball inside, it makes it useful in the game,” Harbhajan said during a virtual press conference organised by Star Sports. “If he can get two wickets early in the game, I’m not saying that right-handers can’t do that, but a left-hand seamer can get an actual angle to get the wicket.” Citing the example of Australia’s Mitchell Starc, he said: “You can see how Shaheen Shah Afridi or Mitchell Starc, they have a huge impact on the game. “When Australia won the World Cup, Mitchell Starc had a huge impact on the games; he sent Brendan McCullum out on the first ball. Incoming ball, with that speed, coming into a right-hander is always challenging.” Chahal would have been in the playing XI all the time Backing Chahal’s inclusion, Harbhajan said: “Chahal is a proven match winner, someone who has taken more number of wickets than any other spinner, and if he was playing for any other country, I think he would have been in the playing XI all the time. Advertisement “Despite proving so much, I think he should be in the team. If I was part of the management, I would definitely keep him in the team. Because we are all stakeholders of Indian cricket. And we want Indian cricket to do well. “These two guys could have been very handy in the World Cup, especially in conditions where they know what to do and how to take wickets. So, I believe these two guys, simply in India, have missed it.” Harbhajan said he was astonished to see no right-arm spinners in the squad. “We have chosen two left-arm spinners, and both of them will never play in the same match. The day Ravindra Jadeja plays, Axar won’t. “And it’s also possible that when there are a lot of left-handers in the opposition, Jadeja may not even bowl. That day, you need a bowler who can take the ball away of the left-arm batters. Advertisement “So, Chahal and Arshdeep should have been in the team, but in whose place could be a big debate. “When you are picking three spinners, it should have been a combination of leftarm plus an offspinner or legspinner. But I’m astonished when you are neither picking a legspinner nor an offspinner, and taking two leftarmers.” “Suryakumar is a complete package” Harbhajan sees Suryakumar Yadav as the X-factor in the Indian team for the upcoming World Cup and said he is the most impactful middle-order batter in India right now. Despite not able to recreate his T20 magic in the ODI format, Suryakumar, who is the world’s No 1 T20I batter, managed to hold onto his spot in the 15-member squad for the World Cup that had led to a debate over the exclusion of Sanju Samson and rising allrounder Tilak Varma. “Suryakumar is a complete package. In the number where he bats, I don’t think there is any other better player than him in India. What he can accomplish at No 5 or 6, even Virat (Kohli), Rohit (Sharma), or Sanju (Samson) cannot replicate,” he said. Advertisement An ace of 360-degree hitting, Suryakumar is going through a lean patch and has not scored a fifty in his last 18 innings. “Many would say what he has done in ODIs? But the impact he has made in T20s is enough. If plays an impactful innings that would make the difference,” the 43-year-old said. Advertisement “When you bat from the 35th over, you need a game where you can find the gaps in the field, and nobody is better than Surya in doing that. He needs just 30 balls to change the game. “Given a choice, I will make him play every time. You can’t waste such a talent like Surya.” Harbhajan said the onus would be on senior duo of Rohit and Virat to give the team a good start. Advertisement “A lot will depend on Rohit and Virat Kohli and how they bat because Shreyas has just come back from an injury. Ishan Kishan looked good. KL Rahul will play or not, we don’t know. Hardik Pandya will also play a key role like Rohit or Virat. “So, I believe they will all have to come together, play some amazing kind of cricket to lift the Cup. Otherwise, it will be very challenging to be honest.” India will take on arch-rivals Pakistan in the Asia Cup in a Super 4 clash on Sunday and Harbhajan feels it would be a 50-50 contest.

IACC seeks wider consultation on e-commerce policy,"New Delhi: The Indo-American Chamber of Commerce (IACC) on Thursday said that the absence of a draft e-commerce policy is making it difficult for the industry to reach a consensus that could help develop a cohesive policy and unlock growth for the e-commerce sector. “Policymaking for e-commerce should be a carefully calibrated effort to incentivize investment, boost innovation, and encourage competition. And the way to ensure that the policy and rules are positive is by finalizing them only after consensus has emerged through transparent and open consultation with all the relevant stakeholders,"" said Lalit Bhasin, national president, IACC. IACC is an apex bi-lateral body that promotes Indo-American business, trade and economic relations. Its members include India is set to notify the national e-commerce policy and rules that will provide a policy framework for the sector and establish grievance redressal mechanisms for consumers using e-commerce websites. “While the policy has been long awaited by industry, consumers and other stakeholders, it is notable that the last draft of the e-commerce policy was made public four years ago, prior to the pandemic. However, no draft has been shared with the public, including industry, of the current version of the policy. To be sure, it was also noted in reports that a final consultation was held on the e-commerce policy between government officials and industry players as well as industry bodies. According to reports, the government has also mentioned that a broad level of consensus had emerged among concerned stakeholders on the policy,"" IACC said in a press released issued on Thursday. However, without a draft, it may be difficult for industry and stakeholders alike to comment on the provisions that the proposed policy intends to put in place to unlock growth in this key sunrise sector. India’s e-commerce sector has boomed over the last decade, enabled by the penetration of smartphones and greater access to the internet. The size of the e-commerce industry has grown from approximately $13 billion in 2015 to over $63 billion in 2022. “The e-commerce policy is critical because, over the last decade or so, this sector has emerged as a vital pillar of the Indian economy. It has also had a transformative impact on the lives of millions of Indians. It has catalysed the creation of end-to-end digitally enabled supply chains and value-added services for businesses and consumers. The expanded market access for MSME and small-town sellers, enabled by e-commerce, is a retail revolution that has not only driven their growth but has also spawned ancillary industries such as logistics, data analytics,"" the industry body said. As a result, the e-commerce sector is simultaneously massive and multi-faceted in its impact and benefits. “Any policy or regulation for the e-commerce sector must be designed to ensure that its growth is not impeded,"" it further said. E-commerce already comes within the ambit of multiple laws including the recently passed Digital Data Protection Act as well as current regulations governing business compliance, competition, and consumer protection. The new e-commerce policy will, hopefully, be in sync with these existing laws without increasing the compliance burden on a sunrise sector that has a multiplier effect on economic growth, job creation, export orientation, and consumer empowerment,",business

Bengaluru-based filmmaker Vinod Rajendra is behind South Western Railway’s latest safety awareness campaign,"After documentaries on dance, art, and heritage, Bengaluru-based filmmaker Vinod Rajendra changes tracks with a project for South Western Railway. Titled The First Journey , the recently-released safety awareness campaign began in January and is supported by the ICICI Foundation. “13 2D animated ads, three live-action short fiction films, and six educational/documentary shorts have been created,” says Vinod, who is known for documentaries Lepakshi and Change — which created Guinness World Records as most dubbed short documentary and most dubbed short fiction respectively for being dubbed in 11 languages Vinod explains how his father and grandfather are retired employees of the Indian Railways and a few relatives are still working with the department. “I have always had a fondness for the Indian Railways. Growing up, my favourite evening spot after school was my hometown Hindupur’s railway station. I used to walk about the platform and watch trains passing by.” Which is why the subject remains close to his heart. “The idea of the project is to make passengers aware of safe travel methods,” says Vinod, 31, whose animated films discuss subjects such as issues of boarding and alighting a moving train, carrying inflammables, and how to avoid level crossing accidents, among others. The documentaries After Effects of Stone Pelting , Rolling In and Rolling Out , Points Man , Gate Man , and Safety Counsellor , tackle the perils of stone pelting, safety protocols to be followed, the safety of employees, etc. “We shot all the films at railway stations in and around KSR Bengaluru City Junction and Yelahanka Junction,” says Vinod, whose team primarily comprises freelancers. “For each of my projects, I prefer working with new talent as I could learn from them. For The First Journey , I had a team of around 25 people.” He adds that since the attention span of people has reduced, the media content ranges from just 20 seconds to four minutes each. Soon, the films will be screened in theaters, at railway stations, on social media platforms, etc. “The films have also been translated into English, Telugu, Kannada, and Tamil to reach a wider audience,” says Vinod, who is now working on pitches for an animated short on Krishna Devaraya and a live-action documentary on Bharatanatyam.",entertainment
"Tech Briefing today: iPhone 15 prices leaked, ISRO shares Aditya-L1 selfie, YouTube gaming, more","Tech Briefing today: Today was an eventful day in the world of technology. A new leak has surfaced online that has revealed the possible prices for the iPhone 15 series. As per the leaks, the Pro models can witness a price hike. In other news, the official X account of ISRO shared a selfie taken by the camera onboard Aditya-L1 solar mission, which is currently on its way to the Lagrange 1 (L1) point between the Sun and the Earth. This marked a big moment for the space agency as it was also able to test the cameras on the spacecraft. This and more in today's tech briefing. Let us take a look. iPhone 15 series price leaked Over the past few weeks, leaks have suggested that iPhone 15 Pro models may get a price hike of $100 and $200. This may come true as the Pro versions come with various new upgrades that can push up the cost of manufacturing significantly. Some of them include a titanium frame, a display with thinner bezels, an action button, and more. As per a Tom's Guide report , the iPhone 15 price may start from $799 and as for the iPhone 15 Plus, it may start from $899. If this turns out to be true, then the standard models will not see any price hike. However, this is not etched in stone. The base iPhone 15 and Plus models are also getting big upgrades and it remains to be seen whether the price hike may happen. However, the iPhone 15 Pro models' prices are expected to rise. The iPhone 15 Pro may cost around $1099, while the iPhone 15 Pro Max may cost $1199 or even $1299. The iPhone 15 Pro Max may even get a $200 hike in price because of the new periscope zoom lens.

Performax to expand footprint to 20k stores by 2025,"is set to broaden distribution of its sportswear brand, Performax, by reaching out to small retail shops, departmental stores, and stand-alone outlets, and increase its network to 20,000-plus outlets, said a senior company executive. It also seeks to grow its business fivefold within two years, positioning itself as a competitor to Puma and Reebok, said Akhilesh Prasad, the president and chief executive officer of Reliance Retail–Fashion and Lifestyle, in an interview. “All I will say now is that by 2025 Performax will be growing at least five times."" Performax, the value sportswear brand of Reliance Retail, is primarily available through the Reliance Trends stores. Performax has signed a multi-year agreement with the All India Football Federation, the governing body, as the official kit and merchandise sponsor for Indian men, women as well as youth football teams, having exclusive right to produce kits for all formats of the game. The brand also has the privilege to sell these products in the open market as AIFF’s merchandise sponsor. Blue Tigers, India’s national football team, will inaugurate the new kit at the 49th King’s Cup tournament in Thailand on 7-10 September. Reliance already has significant presence in India’s sports landscape, with ownership of IPL franchise Mumbai Indians and a stake in ISL, India’s football league. Besides, its sports marketing arm RISE Worldwide, manages top cricketers, including Team India Captain Rohit Sharma, Hardik Pandya, Jasprit Bumrah, Suryakumar Yadav, Shreyas Iyer, Ishan Kishan and Krunal Pandya. “Now, we have chosen football as it will have the widest impact,"" said Prasad. However he declined to share financials of the brands association with the football federation. Last year, Performax had appointed Bumrah as its brand ambassador. It has also partnered with athletes, including Ravi Dahiya, Harmilan Kaur, Manu Bhaker, Yogesh Kathuniya, Ridhi Phor, and Pramod Bhagat. Performax Activewear pro-ducts, like accessories, apparel and footwear are available at 1,500-plus stores, besides Ajio and JioMart, for 1,000 or less. “We see Performax being made available in at least 20,000 retail points in the country—our own network, plus large format retail stores, chain stores, departmental stores along with mom-pop stores etc. As part of this, 15-20% stores will be Reliance Retail,"" he said. The brand has already debuted stand-alone stores. Prasad said the retailer could eye the top 200 cities to open stand-alone Performax stores. It already has 11 such stores. To be sure, India’s market for sports and active wear has grown as the country’s young population participates in various sporting activities. However, foreign retailers such as Puma, Reebok, Nike, and Adidas have garnered high shares in the organized market for sporting goods and clothing. Prasad said international brands lack the appeal and price points to reach the masses. “If you look at the Indian scenario, we have got only international brands,"" he said. Performax may partner with other grassroots sports by sponsoring sporting events at the school and college level, said Prasad. Reliance Retail is the country’s largest retailer--it operates various fashion and lifestyle brands and retail formats in the country such as Reliance Trends, Azorte, Yousta, Gap, M&S, among others.",business
Google building more employee ‘Wellness Centers’ for on-campus healthcare,"Google is famous for providing its employees with various perks, with the idea that it will aid and let them focus on work. To coincide with the return to office trend, the Google Wellness Center benefit is now expanding across the US to offer more healthcare services. Google opened its first Wellness Center in 2010 to provide on-campus health care. This includes annual check-ups and simple flu shots as well as mental health, physical therapy and chiropractic care, health coaching, and lab orders.

Today, the company announced internally, and shared with us, that these Wellness Centers are coming to more locations in the US and expanding what they’re offering.

Google Calendar can now hide completed tasks,"After rolling out Material You widgets on Android, Google Calendar is now hiding completed tasks by default. Google Calendar on the web today is prompting some users about how “Completed tasks are now hidden: Use this menu to show or hide completed tasks.” You can change the new default by clicking the time period (Day, Week, Month, Year, Schedule, or 4 days) view switcher. At the bottom, “Show completed tasks” joins “Show weekends” and “Show declined events.” Some users don’t like seeing reminders that they’ve accomplished, especially minor, repetitive ones, while others prefer having it preserved alongside other calendar events. ( Tangent : Automatically-created flight events from Gmail will disappear after some time. Events should really be permanent once they appear in Calendar.) It’s useful when looking back, though this can also be done inside Google Tasks. We’re not yet seeing the matching setting on the Android or iOS apps, even if it’s available on the web for your account. It’s not clear if this is a per-instance setting or account-wide. Otherwise, Google is still rolling out this setting. More on Google Calendar:",technology
"Morning Digest | African Union to join G-20 as Sherpas reach a deal; Delhi may turn venue for dialogue on reviving the Black Sea Grain Initiative, and more","African Union to join G-20, as Sherpas reach a deal The African Union (AU) is set to join the G-20 as negotiators agreed on clearing its membership, according to sources privy to the discussions at the Sherpa meeting at a resort on the outskirts of Delhi. This will mean the 55-member AU will join the European Union as the only two regional bodies in the G-20. While it still unclear whether the G-20 will be renamed as the “G-21” after the induction of the AU, Indian officials said the announcement would help “leave a lasting imprint” of the work the Indian Presidency has done in bringing in the Global South’s ambitions to the economic grouping. Delhi may turn venue for dialogue on reviving the Black Sea Grain Initiative As world leaders gather in Delhi on Friday ahead of the G-20 summit, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is on a mission to revive the Black Sea Grain Initiative (BSGI or BSI), in talks on the sidelines of the summit hosted by India. The deal that facilitates export of grain from Russia and Ukraine lapsed in July. Among those in Delhi, Turkiye President Recep Erdogan, who met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Sochi earlier this week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, as well as leaders of European Union and UN officials will be trying to work a compromise that would give assurances to Russia, for an exchange that would allow grain export from blockaded Ukrainian ports to restart at the earliest, sources told The Hindu. At G-20, Japan backs India, not China, as bridge to Global South: Japanese experts Beyond the immediate outcomes of the G-20 Summit, one key takeaway with longer term implications is the positioning of India as a key bridge to the “Global South” for Japan and the West, in the view of Japanese experts. “Japan sees a rivalry over the leadership of the ‘Global South’ between India and China, and it is in the interest of Japan and the G-7 that India plays a leading role in the ‘Global South’, not China,” said Hiroyuki Akita, Tokyo-based strategic affairs commentator at Nikkei, in an interview with The Hindu. Modi, Biden to discuss trade issues, jet engine, drone deals during meet Progress on the deal to jointly manufacture jet engines in India, purchase of MQ-9B armed drones, agreement on civil nuclear liability and trade are expected to be the top issues on the agenda as Prime Minister Narendra Modi and U.S. President Joe Biden hold bilateral talks late on Friday, a day before the G-20 summit. Further discussions as well as some of the deals are expected in January when Mr. Biden is likely to visit India and officials said India is looking to have the Quad leaders summit on January 26 or a day before possibly with the leaders as chief guests. Bharat Jodo Yatra was a people’s movement: Congress Calling the Bharat Jodo Yatra a people’s movement “unequalled” in history, Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge on September 7 said the Yatra seeks to bring real issues like economic inequalities, price rise, unemployment, social injustice and subversion of the Constitution to the fore. Mr. Kharge also slammed the trend of “manufacturing headlines” to divert attention from the real issues of the people. Assets worth over $1.8 billion recovered under Fugitive Economic Offenders Act in four years: Union Minister Jitendra Singh Union Minister Jitendra Singh on Thursday said assets worth more than $12 billion had been attached since 2014 under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), while in the past about four years, assets worth over $1.8 billion had been recovered under the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act (FEOA).

U.N. chief says ‘systematic repression’ crushing Myanmar democracy hopes Hopes of a return to democracy in junta-ruled Myanmar are being crushed by “systematic repression”, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on September 7 at a summit in Indonesia with the United States, China and regional leaders. Myanmar has been ravaged by deadly violence since a 2021 military coup ousted Aung San Suu Kyi’s government, unleashing a bloody crackdown on dissent. Indonesia warns against new conflicts as U.S., China, Russia attend ASEAN summit Indonesia warned leaders including U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov against sharpening rivalries as they wrapped up an East Asia summit in Jakarta on Thursday. The meeting brought Washington and Beijing into contact a day after Mr. Li warned major powers must manage differences to avoid a “new Cold War”, and ahead of the G20 summit in New Delhi this week that Chinese President Xi Jinping will miss. Interactions between the officials from the world’s top two economies are being closely watched as they seek to control tensions that risk flaring anew over issues ranging from Taiwan to ties with Moscow and the competition for influence in the Pacific. India keen on having Quad leaders as Chief Guests for 2024 Republic Day parade India is discussing the possibility of inviting leaders of the Quad grouping, comprising of India, Australia, Japan and the U.S., to the Republic Day parade on January 26, diplomatic sources confirmed. The possibility of U.S. President Joe Biden being the Chief Guest for the parade, with the Quad summit held a day prior, on January 25, is also being looked into, but given that January 26 is observed as Australia Day, it would be extremely difficult for their Prime Minister to be in India on that day, an official source said. Caste discrimination survey in IIT-Delhi commenced and withdrawn After two Dalit students allegedly committed suicide at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Delhi in the past two months, a campus-wide survey on caste discrimination circulated by the institute’s Board of Student Publications (BSP) was been suspended within hours of commencing. As soon as the survey was shared, complaints said the survey’s design was “biased, insensitive, and problematic”, with the institute’s official Scheduled Caste (SC)/Scheduled Tribe (ST) Cell stating that it had not been consulted on the survey.

Gukesh excited about the Asian Games, feels India has a fair chance He was the undoubted star of last year’s Chess Olympiad in Chennai, and now D. Gukesh is excited about the Asian Games, beginning at Hangzhou later this month. Chess is making a comeback to the Asian Games after a gap of 13 years, just in time for the massively talented young Indians like Gukesh. “I am very excited about my first ever Asian Games,” he said at a media interaction here on Thursday. “It is a prestigious event and I look forward to watching athletes in other sports. I love badminton, and I would like to watch it if I could.” Gukesh, who recently broke into the World top 10, believes India has fair chances on the chessboard. “But there are other strong teams,” he said. “And we had a camp here with Boris Gelfand. It went off very well. It was very tiring, which is usually good. The camp was brilliant.”",world
North Korea says it has launched a new nuclear attack submarine to counter U.S. naval power,"North Korea said on September 8 it has launched a purported nuclear attack submarine it has been developing for years, a step leader Kim Jong Un described as crucial in his efforts to build a nuclear-armed navy to counter the United States and its Asian allies. The North’s official Korean Central News Agency said the vessel – named “Hero Kim Kun Ok” – is designed to launch tactical nuclear weapons from underwater but did not specify the number of missiles it could carry and fire. In his speeches at the vessel’s launching ceremony on Wednesday and an onboard inspection on Thursday, Mr. Kim expressed satisfaction that the country has acquired its own nuclear attack submarine to counter the advanced naval assets of the U.S., KCNA said. In July, the U.S. docked a nuclear-capable ballistic missile submarine in South Korea for the first time since the 1980s. Also read: Explained | Record missile tests and military exercises — what is happening in the Korean Peninsula? Mr. Kim said the country is also pursuing a nuclear-propelled submarine and plans to remodel its existing submarines and surface vessels so that they could handle nuclear weapons, describing the building of a nuclear-capable army as an “urgent task.” Based on Mr. Kim’s comments and photos by North Korean state media, it’s likely the new submarine was the same one Mr. Kim inspected in 2019 while it was under construction, which experts then assessed as an effort to convert an existing Romeo-class submarine. The submarine appears to have at least 10 launch tubes — four of them larger than the other six — that are possibly designed for ballistic and cruise missile launches. North Korea previously had been testing a variety of missiles designed to be fired from submarines as it pursued an ability to conduct nuclear strikes from underwater, which in theory would bolster its deterrent by ensuring a survivable capability to retaliate after absorbing a nuclear attack on land. Ballistic missile submarines would also add a maritime threat to the North’s growing collection of solid-fuel weapons fired from land vehicles that are designed to overwhelm missile defenses in South Korea and Japan. The two key U.S. allies station tens of thousands of U.S. troops in the region. It would take considerable time, resources and technological improvements for the heavily sanctioned nation to build a fleet of at least several submarines that could travel quietly in seas and reliably execute attacks, analysts say. “The nuclear attack submarine, for decades a symbol of aggression against our republic, has now become a symbol of our revolutionary power to strike fear into the hearts of our despicable enemies,” KCNA quoted Mr. Kim as saying. He insisted that the submarine would be just as “daunting” to his enemies as the nuclear-propelled submarine North Korea plans to acquire in the future. “In submarines, technical aspects such as the power system, submergence speed, and the level of navigational equipment are all very important and would generally define [the vessels’] operational capabilities, but nothing is more important than the type of weaponry that could be installed,” he said. North Korea previously had only one known submarine capable of firing a missile, but that vessel has a single launch tube and analysts had considered it a test platform, rather than an active operational weapons system. North Korea has an estimated about 70-90 diesel-powered submarines in one of the world’s largest submarine fleets. But they are mostly aging ones capable of launching only torpedoes and mines, not missiles. The report about the new submarine came amid speculation that Mr. Kim is preparing to visit Russia soon for a meeting with President Vladimir Putin that could focus on North Korean arms sales to refill Russian reserves drained by its war on Ukraine. In exchange for providing Russia with artillery shells and other ammunition, North Korea could seek badly needed economic aid and also advanced weapons technologies, including those related to submarine-launched ballistic missile systems, intercontinental ballistic missiles and military spy satellites, analysts say. KCNA said the launching of the new submarine was timed for the 75th anniversary of the country’s founding, which falls on Saturday and was to be marked by festivities, including a paramilitary parade.",world
"Hong Kong's heaviest rain in at least 140 years floods city streets, metro","Torrential rain deluged Hong Kong on September 8, leading to widespread flooding across the densely packed city, submerging streets, shopping malls and metro stations, as authorities shut schools and asked workers to stay at home. The Chinese special administrative region saw the highest hourly rainfall since records began 140 years ago. Hong Kong Observatory reported rainfall of 158.1 millimetres (6.2 inches) between 11 p.m. HKT on Thursday and midnight on Friday (1500 to 1600 GMT on Thursday). The weather bureau issued the highest ""black"" rainstorm warning and said more than 200 mm of rainfall was recorded on Hong Kong's main island, Kowloon and the northeastern part of the city's New Territories since Thursday night. The trough of low pressure associated with the remnant of Typhoon Haikui has brought torrential rain to the coast of Guangdong since Thursday, the weather bureau said. Extreme conditions are expected to last until at least noon on Friday. Hong Kong's stock exchange will not open on Friday morning if the black rainstorm warning is still in place at 9 a.m., the exchange said. City leader John Lee said he was very concerned about the severe flooding in most parts of the territory and had instructed all departments to respond with ""all-out efforts"". Videos circulating on social media showed streets turning into raging rivers, while one clip showed water gushing down an escalator into a swamped subway station. The city's cross harbour tunnel, one of main arteries connecting Hong Kong island to Kowloon, was also inundated with water, while photos showed a waterlogged shopping centre in the Chai Wan district. Hong Kong's MTR Corp which operates the city's rail network said at least one line was shut while others were operating at delayed intervals. All schools have been suspended on Friday due to ""extreme conditions caused by extensive flooding and serious traffic disruption,"" the government said. It appealed to employers to observe work arrangements normally used for the strong wind signal 8, which brings the city to an effective standstill with offices and stores shut.",world
Sudan’s army chief travels to Qatar for talks with emir as conflict rages,"Sudan's army chief travelled to Qatar on September 7 for talks with the country's emir, making his third international trip since fighting broke out between the military and a rival paramilitary force in April, Sudanese state media said. Sudan plunged into chaos almost five months ago when long-simmering tensions between the military, led by Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan and the Rapid Support Forces, commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, escalated into open warfare on April 15. Burhan planned to hold talks with Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, in the Qatari capital, Doha, according to the state-run SUNA news agency. In a video posted by the Sudanese army, Burhan was filmed leaving a plane in Doha and numerous Qatari officials greeting him on an airport tarmac. The army chief's arrival was also confirmed by the state-run Qatar News Agency . During their meeting, Burhan and Al Thani discussed the challenges facing conflict-stricken Sudan, The Emiri Diwan said in statement. Al Thani reiterated his call for broad peace negotiations between all of Sudan's political forces and a lasting stop to the fighting, the statement said. Acting Foreign Minister Ali al-Sadiq and Gen. Ahmed Ibrahim Mufadel, head of the General Intelligence Authority, accompanied Burhan on the trip, SUNA said. The visit comes amid a flurry of similar diplomatic meetings convened in Egypt and South Sudan. Burhan held talks about the conflict with South Sudan's president, Salva Kiir, on Monday in Juba. Last week, the general met with President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi of Egypt in the Egyptian coastal city of el-Alamein, Burhan's first trip abroad since the conflict broke out. Few details were made public about either trip. The conflict in the northeast African country is estimated to have killed at least 4,000 people, according to the U.N. human rights office. Activists and doctors on the ground say the toll is likely far higher. The fighting has displaced more than 5 million people, according to the most recent figures produced by the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration. Despite international efforts, the conflict has shown few signs of easing. Formal peace negations mediated by the United States and Saudi Arabia in the kingdom’s coastal town of Jeddah were adjourned in late June with both mediators publicly calling out the Rapid Support Forces and the army for continually violating agreed-to truces. There have been at least nine cease-fires between the army and the RSF since the fighting broke out. All were violated.",world
Coco Gauff tops Karolina Muchova to reach the US Open final,"Coco Gauff never wavered. Not when a big lead in the first set evaporated. Not when match point after match point went by the wayside. And not, most distracting of all, when her U.S. Open semifinal against Karolina Muchova was interrupted for 50 minutes Thursday night by environmental activists — one of whom glued his bare feet to the concrete floor in the stands. Coco Gauff of the U.S. celebrates after winning her semi final match against Czech Republic's Karolina Muchova(REUTERS) It’s been rather obvious for quite some time that Gauff is no ordinary teenager. Now she is one win away from becoming a Grand Slam champion. Gauff, a 19-year-old from Florida, reached her first final at Flushing Meadows by defeating Muchova 6-4, 7-5 on what was anything but an ordinary evening. The toughest part for Gauff might have been closing out the victory: She needed six match points to get it done, raucously supported by a loud, partisan crowd that chair umpire Alison Hughes repeatedly implored to quiet down. After failing to convert one match point while serving for the win at 5-3, then another four in what turned out to be the last game, Gauff got the last chance she would need when she smacked a forehand winner to cap a 40-stroke exchange that was the longest of the contest. Muchova then missed a backhand to end it. “Some of those points, it was so loud, and I don’t know if my ears are going to be OK,” said Gauff, the first American teenager to make it to the title match in New York since Serena Williams in 2001. “I grew up watching this tournament so much, so it means a lot to be in the final. A lot to celebrate,” Gauff said. “But the job is not done, so hopefully you can back me on Saturday.” She was up by a set and 1-0 in the second when four protesters disrupted play from seats in an upper level of the arena. All four were arrested; three were escorted away relatively quickly, but it took more time to remove the person glued to the ground. Both women spent time in the locker room during the delay. When action resumed, the play was pretty even for several games. But then Gauff surged ahead and got her first match point, but Muchova erased that with a volley winner and would go on to break back. They would play on for nearly a half-hour. With Gauff leading 6-5 and Muchova serving, the one-point-away count kept climbing. Muchova resisted. Gauff was unable to pull through. Once. Twice. Three times. Four. In that game alone, Gauff kept getting so near to the finish line. The roars from the seats kept coming. Finally, Gauff completed her 11th win a row and the 17th in her past 18 matches, a run that began after a first-round exit at Wimbledon in July. The streak includes the two biggest titles of Gauff's career — and now she needs one more win to get an even more important championship. She was the runner-up at the 2022 French Open and will try to claim her first Grand Slam title. The No. 6-seeded Gauff will face No. 2 Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus or No. 17 Madison Keys of the U.S. on Saturday. Sabalenka, who won the Australian Open in January and is guaranteed to move up to No. 1 in the rankings for the first time next week, and Keys, the runner-up at the 2017 U.S. Open, were scheduled to meet in the second semifinal Thursday night. “I may watch some of the match.

Maybe not,” Gauff said. “I haven't thought that far ahead, to be honest.” When Gauff and Muchova got started at 7:15 p.m., it was cloudy and considerably cooler than it’s been this week at Flushing Meadows, dropping from nearly 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 Celsius) on Wednesday to the low 80s F (high 20s C). Gauff was terrific in the early stages: She took 12 of the first 16 points for a 3-0 lead after merely 10 minutes. One real key in that stretch: Gauff did not let No. 10 seed Muchova, a 27-year-old from the Czech Republic, get comfortable at the net, where her varied style often pays dividends. Muchova lost the point on her first three forays forward — and Gauff curled perfect a lob winner once in each of the opening two games. By match's end, Muchova had gone just 10 for 24 at the net. Gauff went up 5-1, before Muchova raised her level and pulled within 5-4. But Gauff broke to take that opening set. Just a few minutes later, though, came the delay. At first, Gauff sat on her sideline chair, using a plastic fork to eat some fruit from a container. Then she got some tennis balls and stepped back on court to hit a few practice serves. Muchova asked to be visited by a physiotherapist during the extended break, although it was not immediately clear why. She competed earlier in the tournament with tape near her right elbow and showed up for this match with a full black sleeve on that arm. If she wasn't at 100% — what player is by this point of the season? — Gauff deserved credit for finding the right times to let Muchova miss as opposed to trying to get too aggressive. Muchova made a total of 36 unforced errors, 11 more than Gauff. What Gauff also displayed was that she was ready for the moment, the sort of success predicted of her since, at age 15 in 2019, she became the youngest qualifier in Wimbledon history and got to the fourth round there.

France beat Ireland 2-0 to stay perfect in European Championship qualifiers,"France extended its perfect start to its European Championship qualifying campaign to five matches with a 2-0 win over Ireland on Thursday. (From L to R) Dayot Upamecano, Theo Hernandez, Adrien Rabiot, Kylian Mbappe, Lucas Hernandez and Antoine Griezmann celebrate the second goal during the UEFA Euro 2024 football tournament Group B qualifying match between France and Republic of Ireland(AFP) A spot at the continental tournament in Germany next summer now looks all but secured for the two-time champion. Didier Deschamps' team has been rock solid so far and has not conceded a goal, topping Group B with 15 points and a nine-point lead over the Netherlands and Greece. The Dutch, who defeated their Greek rivals 3-0, have two matches in hand. Aurelien Tchouameni and Marcus Thuram scored France’s goals at the Parc des Princes. The game was played at Paris Saint-Germain's stadium because of the Rugby World Cup’s opening game scheduled Friday at the Stade de France. Deschamps made four changes to the team that defeated Greece 1-0 in the previous game, with striker Olivier Giroud starting up front in place of Randal Kolo Muani. Giroud’s 125th appearance did not last long, though, as he was replaced by Thuram after just 25 minutes with an apparent ankle injury following contact with an Irish player. Playing in front of his home crowd, PSG forward Kylian Mbappe delivered the assist for Tchouameni’s opener. Another PSG player, Ousmane Dembele, was a threat throughout down the right. Irish forward Chiedozie Ogbene's pace down the right flank faded quite quickly, and France took control after Tchouameni broke the deadlock in the 19th minute. Before that, a direct free kick from Antoine Griezmann had almost caught Gavin Bazunu off guard, but the Ireland goalkeeper managed to clear the ball with his chest. There was not much Bazunu could do three minutes later when Tchouameni made the most of Mbappe’s back pass just outside the box to curl a superb 25-meter shot inside the far post. Mbappe thought he had doubled France’s lead before the interval following a quick combination with Thuram, but a VAR check confirmed his teammate was in an offside position in the buildup. Thuram made it 2-0 in the 48th from the rebound after Mbappe’s shot from inside the box was blocked. France goalkeeper Mike Maignan then ensured yet another clean sheet with a reflex save to deny Ogbene’s header. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics Kylian Mbappe Uefa",sports
Lionel Messi magic earns Argentina win over Ecuador in World Cup qualifier,"Lionel Messi’s second-half goal gave Argentina a 1-0 home win over Ecuador on Thursday to get their 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign off on the right foot. World champions Argentina were dominant in possession but frustrated in attack as they struggled to make the breakthrough. Captain Messi, however, continued the fine form he is showing with club side Inter Miami by scoring from a free kick after 77 minutes. “We played against a great team, with good players and physically strong,” Messi told reporters. “Everyone always wants to beat Argentina and even more so now that we are the world champions. We can’t relax, we have to improve on what we’ve been doing. “The objective is to qualify for the World Cup again. We really enjoyed what we did but we have to look ahead.” Messi’s goal also tied him with close friend Luis Suarez of Uruguay as the all-time top scorer in the South American qualifying competition with 29.

"Climate protester glues feet to floor, interrupting US Open semifinal between Gauff and Muchova","The US Open semifinal between Coco Gauff and Karolina Muchova was delayed by 50 minutes because of a disruption by four environmental activists in the Arthur Ashe Stadium stands on Thursday night. One protester glued his bare feet to the concrete floor. Gauff was ahead 6-4, 1-0 when play was halted early in the second set. Security guards and, later, more than a half-dozen police officers went over to confront the protesters, who were wearing shirts that read, “End Fossil Fuels.” The US Tennis Association said three of the protesters were escorted out of the stadium without further incident, but it took longer to remove the person who stuck his feet to the ground. The USTA added that NYPD and medical personnel were needed in order to safely remove that person and that all four had been taken into police custody. Spectators were asked to move away to clear a path for the police, who were cheered by fans sitting near the section where the disruption happened. One of the protesters, who identified himself only as Ian, said they wanted the US Open to be accountable because it has sponsors who are large corporations whose policies are contributing to global warming. “We are not trying to harm the athletes in any way. We have nothing against the sport, but we are really trying to draw attention to an issue here that there will be no tennis left for anybody in the world to enjoy,” he said. Advertisement Gauff sat on her sideline bench for a bit during the break in the match, eating fruit out of a plastic container, before then getting some tennis balls and hitting a few practice serves. Muchova was briefly visited by a trainer during the interruption. Later, both players headed toward the locker room as the delay continued. Gauff sat on a treadmill, a towel draped over her lap, while chatting with members of her team. It is the latest in a recent series of protests at sporting events — and tennis, in particular — related to the use of fossil fuels. Advertisement At Wimbledon in July, two matches were interrupted when environmental activists jumped out of the stands at Court 18 and scattered orange confetti on the grass. At a US Open tune-up tournament in Washington last month, about a dozen people were asked to leave the site after chanting and displaying signs protesting the use of fossil fuels.

Saudi transfer window closes after a $1 billion spending spree on football stars,"After an outlay of $1 billion, Saudi Arabia’s transfer window shut on Thursday with the oil-rich kingdom having announced itself as a new powerhouse in global soccer. Leading target Mohamed Salah may not have joined Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar and Karim Benzema by moving to the lucrative Saudi Pro League, but it seems inevitable more stars will eventually be lured away from Europe’s biggest clubs. Liverpool last week reportedly rejected a bid worth 150 million pounds ($188 million) from Al-Ittihad for Salah and despite speculation a renewed offer would come before Thursday’s deadline, no deal was struck for the Egypt international. There is, however, little suggestion Saudi Arabia’s spectacular spending will end there as the country has sought to buy its way into international sports, investing in recent years in golf, boxing, Formula One racing and tennis, as well as soccer. While that has led to accusations of “sportswashing” in a bid to improve the country’s image in the face of its poor human rights record, Saudi Arabia has continued to spend lavishly as it seeks to raise the profile of its soccer league. Based on reported fees, Saudi clubs paid just over $1 billion on players, which would place it behind only the English Premier League in terms of global spending during the window. Then there are the exorbitant salaries said to be on offer, with Ronaldo’s deal reportedly worth up to $200 million a year. Advertisement Despite anticipation that Salah could be the latest superstar signing, the Saudi window ended relatively quietly. Demarai Gray joined Al-Ettifaq from Everton and Luiz Felipe completed a move from Real Betis to Al-Ittihad. There was also speculation that Manchester United winger Jadon Sancho could join the exodus, but a move did not materialize. The transfer business of Saudi’s leading clubs has been spectacular enough, even without a deadline day deal for Salah. Advertisement Ronaldo’s decision to join Al-Nassr in December has paved the way for more of the world’s leading players to head to the country. Champions League winners N’Golo Kante, Sadio Mane, Riyad Mahrez, Roberto Firmino, Jordan Henderson, Fabinho and Aymeric Laporte have joined Benzema and Neymar as star recruits to a league that was previously little known outside of the region. Failed attempts were made for Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe. The push is backed by the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund, which took up a majority ownership stake in four of its top clubs, Al-Ittihad, Al-Ahli, Al-Nassr, and Al Hilal. The moves into sport are cast as part of efforts by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to leverage the kingdom’s oil wealth to provide new jobs and opportunities for the country’s youth. Advertisement While critics have dismissed it as “sportswashing,” Yannick Carrasco, who joined Al Shabab from Atlético Madrid earlier this week, defended Saudi Arabia on Thursday. “I see how women live there, and how people go about their lives,” he said during a news conference with Belgium’s national team. “Honestly, it is a beautiful country. It is hard to judge if you only listen to what people say about it. You have to experience it yourself.” Advertisement UN human rights experts, however, criticized Saudi Arabia in July for lengthy prison sentences given to two women who tweeted criticism of the kingdom’s policies. As well its drive to improve its domestic league, Saudi Arabia also has a foot in the Premier League after PIF bought Newcastle United in 2021, with its financial backing enabling the club to qualify for this season’s Champions League. Advertisement There is also speculation Saudi Arabia will bid to host the 2030 men’s soccer World Cup. Neymar proved to be the biggest signing of the window after joining Al Hilal from Paris Saint-Germain. Al Hilal is Saudi’s most successful team, having won the league championship a record 18 times and the Asian Champions League four times. It had already missed out on Messi, who joined MLS club Inter Miami, and bid a record $332 million for Mbappe. As well as Neymar, Al Hilal signed Yassine Bounou, Kalidou Koulibaly, Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, Ruben Neves and Aleksandar Mitrovic.

How To Make Soft Jowar Roti - Try This Fool-Proof Recipe,"Jowar roti has always been considered healthy. In fact, with increased focus on millet in the past few years, it is back in our lives with all glory. So much so that fitness enthusiasts nowadays replace their regular rotis with the ones made with jowar (or sorghum). But making these rotis is not as easy as it seems. People often complain of it getting too hard and unappetizing. Have you faced the same problem while making jowar roti? If yes, then you are just at the right place! We have finally found a fool-proof recipe that will help you make soft and fluffy jowar roti every single time. So, stay back and read through the article to sort out your problem once and for all. Millet is the latest buzzword in the world of fitness. In India, 2023 is celebrated as the 'Year Of Millets', with an aim to shift our focus to the age-old grains, which the seniors at home swear by. One such popular variation of millet is jowar. It is light, easy to digest, and unlike the popular notion (that millets produce heating in the body), jowar is cooling in nature. Besides the generous amount of calcium, potassium, phosphorous and iron makes the grain a super healthy millet to add to your diet. And guess what, it is gluten-free, making the grain ideal for the ones with celiac disease (wheat allergy). Also Read: Give Your Idlis And Dosas A Millet Makeover With These 6 Easy Recipes Jowar is moderate in glycemic index. It contains enough fibre, protein, and other nutrients that make it an ideal food to stabilise the blood sugar levels in the body, lowering diabetes risks. Alongside, it also helps maintain cholesterol levels in the body, further managing your blood pressure level. In fact, experts often recommend jowar roti over atta roti for people with high blood pressure and sugar. The idea is to not let the roti lose its moisture. Hence, the best practice is to make the roti and eat it immediately for the best flavours. But we understand, it is not always a feasible plan. Hence, we got you a recipe by nutritionist Richa Gangani who says, if prepared properly, ""jowar roti has a nice soft texture and even on cooling do not become hard or chewy."" To start with, boil a cup of water in a pan and then add the flour to it. Using boiled water while kneading the dough keeps it soft and moist. Make sure, you mix the water and the flour well when it's hot. Use a ladle for the process. Once the mix cools, knead it into a soft dough. You can dip your hand in cold water and then start the kneading process. Do not let the dough sit for long, it takes away all the moisture. Instead, immediately cut it into small roundels and roll it flat. Finally, on low to medium flame, toast the roti until it puffs up. Transfer it to a place, spread some ghee, and keep it closed until you eat. Also Read: Delicious Weight Loss Breakfast: Jowar Upma To The Rescue Watch the complete recipe below: A post shared by Richa Gangani - Weightloss?Thyroid?PCOS Expert (@dieticianricha2095) According to Richa Gangani, one jowar roti (around 50gm) contains 90kcal, two-gram protein, .5-gram fats, 19.5-gram carbs, and 1.7-gram fibre. Now that you know the exact amount of nutrients in each roti, we suggest, decide the number of rotis in your meal accordingly. The best practice is to consult an expert and understand the nutrients your body needs. Always remember, too much of everything is bad for health.

"Ahead Of G20 Meet, PM To Host Private Dinner For Joe Biden Tonight","The two leaders will have dinner together after bilateral talks. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will host US President Joe Biden for a private dinner tonight at his residence in Delhi, a day before the mega G20 summit. President Biden, who left for India earlier today, is expected to drive straight to PM Modi's residence after his arrival, sources say. The two leaders will have dinner together after bilateral talks. This is President Biden's first visit to India, three months after PM Modi's State visit, during which he hosted the Prime Minister for dinner at the White House. He will leave for Vietnam on Sunday afternoon. PM Modi and the US President are expected to make meaningful advancements on the GE jet engine deal and civil nuclear technology during their bilateral talks, Reuters has quoted National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan as saying. GE opened its gates for the transfer of technology to India for the indigenous manufacture of jet engines in April. The two leaders are also likely to review ongoing cooperation in areas of clean energy, trade, high-technology, defence and how the two countries can contribute in dealing with some of the pressing challenges facing the world, US officials say.

"""Mount Fuji Is Screaming"": Japan Pilgrimage Site Is Flooded With Visitors","Visitor numbers more than doubled between 2012 and 2019 to 5.1 million With its millions of visitors every year and the buses, supply trucks, noodle shops and fridge magnets, Japan's Mount Fuji is no longer the peaceful pilgrimage site it once was. Now authorities have had enough, saying the number of hikers trekking up the world-famous volcano -- night and day -- is dangerous and an ecological embarrassment. ""Mount Fuji is screaming,"" the governor of the local region said last week. Hailing its religious importance and its inspiration to artists, in 2013 UNESCO added the ""internationally recognized icon of Japan"" to its World Heritage List. But as has happened in places such as Bruges in Belgium or Rio de Janeiro's Sugarloaf Mountain, the designation has been both a blessing and a curse. Visitor numbers more than doubled between 2012 and 2019 to 5.1 million, and that's just for Yamanashi prefecture, the main starting point. Day and night It's not just during the day that a stream of people trudges through the black volcanic grit on their way up the 3,776-metre (12,388-foot) mountain. At night, long lines of people -- on their way up to see the sun rise in the morning -- trek upwards with torches on their heads. The main starting-off point is a car park that can only be reached by taxi or buses that take a couple of hours from Tokyo, around 100 kilometres (60 miles) away. Greeting visitors is a complex of restaurants and shops selling souvenirs as well as snacks and drinks for walkers before they set off. They are powered by diesel generators and the thousands of litres of water they use has to be brought up in lorries. Trucks also take all the rubbish down. ""I saw a lot of food waste and empty bottles of drinks lying around the hand-washing area of the toilet,"" complained Japanese hiker Yuzuki Uemura, 28. Dangers Masatake Izumi, a local official, said the high numbers of people increased the risk of accidents. Some people who climb at night ""get hypothermia and have to be taken back to first aid stations"", he told AFP. At least one person has died so far this season. For an optional access fee of 1,000 yen ($6.80), visitors get a booklet in Japanese -- there is a QR code for the English version -- with some dos and don'ts. But some don't realise how tough the five-to-six-hour climb is to the top, where oxygen levels are lower and where the weather can change quickly. ""It's almost winter up there, it's really cold,"" Rasyidah Hanan, a 30-year-old hiker from Malaysia, told AFP on her way down. ""People should be filtered a little bit because some people were not ready to climb Mount Fuji. They were like in really light clothes... Some of them really looked sick."" Crowd control As tourist numbers get back to pre-pandemic levels, it's not only Mount Fuji whose returning crowds have authorities worried. This week government ministers met to discuss measures to tackle what Kenji Hamamoto, a senior Japan Tourism Agency official, called ""overcrowding and breaches of etiquette"" across heavily touristed sites. For Mount Fuji, authorities announced last month that they would impose crowd control measures for the first time if paths got too busy. The announcement alone had an effect and in the end no such measures were taken, Izumi said. Visitor numbers are expected to be down slightly this year from 2019, but in 2024 they could rise again as tourists -- particularly from China -- return. Yamanashi's governor Kotaro Nagasaki said last week Japan needed to take measures to ensure Mount Fuji did not lose its UNESCO designation. One solution, he said, could be constructing a light rail system to replace the main road leading to the main starting point for hikers. ""We firmly believe that with regard to Mount Fuji tourism, a shift from a quantity approach to a quality one is essential,"" Nagasaki said. ""I think that Mount Fuji is one of the things that makes Japan proud,"" said Marina Someya, 28, a Japanese hiker.

Babar Azam vs Virat Kohli: Numbers Reveal The 'Better' Batter,"The first India vs Pakistan match could only see one innings being possible, with rain washing out the second innings. In the match, India's talismanic batter Virat Kohli could only score 4 runs while his rival Babar Azam didn't get the opportunity to bat. Over the years, Kohli and Babar have dominated the run-scoring records, pushing each other to excel for their respective teams. As India and Pakistan square off for one more time in the Super 4 stage of the Asia Cup, the Kohli vs Babar rivalry will be renewed, hopefully without any rain interruption this time. Babar made his ODI debut in 2015 when Virat was almost on the peak of his career. In 2015, both Virat and Babar's ODI average was similar. Virat dominated Babar from 2016 until 2019 where both batters averaged similarly again. This is when a shift was witnessed. Babar had a better average than Virat from 2020 - 2022. It has been World Cup years (2015, 2019, 2023) when they both have similar batting averages. The World Cup years have been turning points in both their careers in terms of batting AVG against each other. Since Babar's ODI debut, Virat has been slightly better than Babar in terms of average and strike-rate. Virat has batted 13 innings more than Babar and has better numbers than Babar in ODIs since the Pakistan batter's debut. Though the Indian cricketer was dismissed on 4 in the last game against Pakistan, he has great numbers against the men from across the border. In the ODI matches played against Pakistan since 2015, Virat has scored 20.6% of the runs scored by Indian batters. His batting average is almost double than that of the other batters against Pakistan since 2015. On the other hand, Babar has struggled against India in ODIs. His High Score against India in ODIs is 48 India in their last encounter against Pakistan, lost all 10 wickets to the pacers - Shaheen (4), Naseem (3) & Rauf (3). Indian batters have comparatively underperformed against pace bowlers in ODIs in the recent. The pace trio of Pakistan - Haris Rauf (9), Naseem Shah (7) and Shaheen Afridi (7) lead the charts of leading wicket-takers in Asia Cup 2023 so far. Advertisement Shaheen has been specifically effective against right-handed batters in ODIs since 2022. He dismissed Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma , Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja in the previous match against India. Shaheen enjoys bowling in the powerplay and the death overs in ODI since 2022. He picked up 2 wickets in each phase against India in the previous match. Indian openers, as a whole, have been quite effective too. They put on a convincing 147 runs opening stand to register a 10 wicket in the last game against Nepal. Rohit and Shubman have started to open the innings for Team India and put on 845 runs in 10 innings which is most by a pair for any wicket in 2023. As an opening pair Rohit and Gill average 93.9 which is the best by an Indian opening pair in a calendar year in ODIs with min. 500 runs. Interestingly Gill features twice in the top 3 pairs.",sports

End of road for communists in Tripura: BJP after bypoll victories,"Synopsis The BJP won the Dhanpur seat for the first time in the Assembly polls held seven months ago and retained it in the by-election. In a significant victory, the ruling party wrested the minority-dominated Boxanagar seat from the CPI(M) in the bypoll.' With these victories, the BJP's tally in the 60-member Assembly increased to 33. Its ally, IPFT, has one MLA, while the Tipra Motha has 13 MLAs, the CPI(M) 10 and the Congress three. PTI The BJP hailed its victory in the bypolls to the Dhanpur and Boxanagar Assembly seats in Tripura on Friday and said it is the end of the road for the communists in the northeastern state, which was once known as a Left bastion. According to the Election Commission (EC), Tafajjal Hossain of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the Boxanagar seat, which has around 66 per cent minority voters, by a margin of 30,237 votes. Hossain got 34,146 votes while Mizan Hossain of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) bagged 3,909 votes. BJP's Bindu Debnath won the Dhanpur seat, which has a significant tribal population, by a margin of 18,871 votes. Debnath got 30,017 votes while Kaushik Chanda of the CPI(M) got 11,146 votes. Both the seats in Sepahijala district witnessed a one-on-one contest between the ruling BJP and the CPI(M) as the two other opposition parties -- Tipra Motha and Congress -- had not fielded candidates. "" BJP wins both Assembly seats in Tripura.... End of the road for the Communists, in what was once their bastion,"" the party's IT department head, Amit Malviya, said in a post on X. Alleging large-scale rigging during the polling and inaction on the part of the EC, the CPI(M) boycotted the counting of votes. Polling for the by-elections was held on September 5. An average turnout of 86.5 per cent was recorded in the two seats. The counting was held at the Sonamura Girls' School amid tight security. The bypoll to the Boxanagar constituency was necessitated by the death of CPI(M) MLA Samsul Haque. Union minister Pratima Bhoumik 's resignation as the MLA from Dhanpur had necessitated the bypoll in that seat. The BJP won the Dhanpur seat for the first time in the Assembly polls held seven months ago and retained it in the by-election. In a significant victory, the ruling party wrested the minority-dominated Boxanagar seat from the CPI(M) in the bypoll.

"INDIA vs 'Bharat': Rahul Gandhi says govt is scared, trying to divert attention","Synopsis Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has accused the Modi government of using name-change tactics to distract from important issues. He also criticized the concentration of power in the hands of a few monopolists, specifically mentioning Adani. These remarks were made during a press conference in Belgium, where Gandhi is on a three-nation European tour. Live | Rahul Gandhi's press meet at Brussels, Belgium Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government is scared and is using the name-change tactics as a distraction from other important issues. ""I don't know if India 's name is being changed, you have to ask the Prime Minister. These are panic reactions. There is fear in the government. These are distraction tactics,"" he said. Taking a dig at BJP and PM Modi , he said, ""The democratic structures of the country are under attack from a group of people who are running India."" When asked about Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge not being invited to the G20 Summit in Delhi, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi said, ""What is contrary about it? They have decided not to invite the Leader of the Opposition. It tells you something. It tells you that they don't value the Leader of 60% of India's population. It's something that people should think about - why they are feeling the need to do that and what is the type of thinking that goes behind that."" He accused the government of trying to change the nature of the country. ""Minorities including Dalits, tribal and lower caste communities are under attack. There is an attempt to change the nature of our country. BJP wants power and wealth to be centralised,"" he said. The remarks by Gandhi were made during a press conference in Belgium. The Congress leader is on a three-nation European tour. While raising the issue of Manipur on the international platform, Gandhi said, ""In Manipur, we want democratic rights, harmony and peace between people. I walked 4000 km for that purpose. The fight for democracy in India is our responsibility, and we will take care of it. The opposition will make sure that the onslaught on our institutions and freedom stops!"" According to PTI sources, the human rights situation in Manipur was among the topics that were raised during his meetings in the Belgian capital. This comes against the backdrop of a resolution entitled 'India, the situation in Manipur' which had been adopted by the European Parliament in July. The discussions in Brussels, which were not listed on the official parliamentary agenda of the day, were described as successful by Opposition party sources. India in the past has said that the Indian authorities at all levels, including the judiciary, are seized of the situation in Manipur and are taking steps to maintain peace and harmony and law and order. ""The European Parliament would be well advised to utilise its time more productively on its internal issues,"" Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said in July when the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the human rights situation in India, with particular reference to the clashes in Manipur. He added that ""such interference in India's internal affairs is unacceptable, and reflects a colonial mindset"". The Indian Overseas Congress is organising the events for Gandhi, a senior party leader said. He is scheduled to return on September 12 night, a day after the conclusion of the G20 Summit. The G20 Leaders Summit will be held from September 9 to 10 in Delhi. (With inputs from agencies) Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories! Get your daily dose of business updates on WhatsApp. click here!

"The dichotomy of expectation: Can designers stay on-brand, but still innovate?","The harshest critic comes alive at couture week like a beast in the night, their eyes scouring the sea of sequins and for any possible error that can prove a designer no longer has ‘the touch’. That coterie of critics is divided into two bivouacs; the kind that tears apart inconsistency, and the kind that tears apart sameness. It becomes an impossible polarity; to stay in keeping with a visual language you have carefully constructed as a designer–but to shock and awe, still. And, in all that, not losing the heart (or the dollar) of the customer that’s championed you year after year… The creation of a visual language is quintessential; to have one is to be adrift in an ocean of fashion talent. “The designers I look up to have definitely created that visual language–the language is their USP,” says luxury content creator Sanjana Batra. “Tarun [Tahiliani] and his mastery of drapes, Gaurav Gupta’s part fantasy, part-futuristic aesthetic, ’s avant-gardeness and use of recycled materials), Rimzim Dadu’s cord technique, Anamika’s modern silhouettes forever rooted in Indian craft…Those elements are part of their DNA” Stylist Mohit Rai agrees, essaying that “the current face of Indian fashion is defined by designers with a very obvious visible signature. ’s thread embroideries, Falguni Shane with their emboldened texturing–and younger brands like Bloni and Two Point Two have become recognizable for their edge, and their use of mixed media.” Legacy brands have more to prove, but Rai believes Abu Jani & Sandeep Khosla and swing it, each time. “Though they’re couture legends, and recognised for many signatures, they continue to experiment with and present new silhouettes, textures, motifs and innovations in pattern-cutting every season.” Stylist Isha Bhansali argues it's the younger designers finding their footing that have it harder. “They’ve only just established themselves, and to wage the battle between creative desire and commerce only becomes harder when you’re new, because you don’t a repeat customer yet; you’re one.” She harkens back to the first designer whose visual language spoke to her– . “Back when I was still a student, not a stylist, (and a commerce student, at that!), I realised I could always recognise his clothes.” The pull the designer feels between letting creativity reign and keeping things consistent is a tough dual act. “As a designer, I feel that there is pressure to surprise a discerning audience with every collection,” says Designer Kanika Goyal. “But it’s about understanding your brand’s evolution as compared to previous seasons, and the vision you have for the coming years.” She advocates that social media has created a sense of urgency for brands to constantly come up with new products. “In the context of Indian designers, it can be both a challenge and an opportunity. Indian designers have a rich cultural heritage and a strong sense of , which gives them a unique perspective on fashion.” But in a scenario where being on-brand is crucial to making sales–and innovating (without losing the plot) is the key to sartorial relevance; is that sweet spot the stuff of myths? Bhansali believes it’s rare, but it can be done. “Some designers play it safe because they know there’s an aesthetic that’s expected of them–but some will surprise you consistently. Of the veterans, I feel like [Rohit Gandhi + Rahul Khanna] always surprise me with their menswear. Their seniority shines through in their craftsmanship, but their ideas are always new. I remember seeing this embellished hoodie in their most recent show; and it was so interesting. They’ve never been designers–they are couturiers through and through–but that hoodie reflected a movement of their brand with the times, without a breach of their ethos.” Batra cites the recent show as an example. “It’s a challenge to stay true to your brand ethos, but also to keep it fresh. Brand integrity is pivotal to a brand, so staying true to that comes first. I think the recent Ritu Kumar show is a good example of that balance; she’s known for her and , but this collection hit refresh on her aesthetic; and it was wearable and contemporary. I think it was the standout show for many people this season because it kept her ethos alive, but gave us refreshingly new work.” It isn’t easy on a designer; and it’s often a conscious (or subconscious) lean into one or the other–breaking ground, or standing yours. “The pressure to innovate and surprise in the fashion industry can coexist with the need to create for the buyer if designers strike a balance between creativity and commercial viability. As a designer, you can do this by understanding the needs and preferences of the buyer and creating designs that meet those needs; in alignment with your brand guidelines,” says Goyal. Signatures are a key pillar of it all–which for Goyal is mixed-media, hand-embroidered or hand-beaded motifs, , deconstructed silhouettes and panelling, colour-blocking, bold print play, distressed two-tone denim treatments. “The fabrics you’ll see most often are silk, cotton, taffeta, wool, faux leather, and recycled polyester,” she adds. Kapoor, alternately, posits that ‘original’ isn’t a very real concept at this point in the timeline anyway. “If you’re authentic, you can look at a million references but you’ll still birth something that would be uniquely yours. It’s always about the tweaks. I strongly feel that everything already exists and as a designer, what I thoroughly enjoy is offering our version of it.” Kapoor’s version is often a broader concept which “always plays with polar worlds–how to overlap two contrasting elements (they always seem to merge at some point), whether it’s street and couture or ancient and new-age.” The tastemakers have changed altogether, says Rai. ““There’s no denying it’s a fine line to tread, but I think–both in India and globally–people are expecting fresher ideas from even the most established of designers. Buying patterns are no longer dictated by store owners– have become the new merchandisers.” It brings us to the core of the apple; Is innovating possible without losing your brand narrative and–as gauche as it might seem to talk about it–your customer? The answer is yes… with an asterisk. Press-perfect answers that talk about how innovation is not only possible, it's ‘always part of every collection’ a designer does ring hollow unless you actually see it in the flesh; and Rai thinks the issue is definitely more local than global. “It’s a slippery slope. On the one hand, everyone wants a business model where they gain recognition for one core product category, so they can become a key seller of that product.” But, he points out, the need to innovate is a creative driver–and it creates a gap in the market for fresh ideas if designers are innovating. A fact that critics globally understand the need for, ""which is why brands like can change up their narratives whenever they feel the need, and no one questions a change of guard with creative directors, who always bring in a new energy and aesthetic key to them. Fashion critics in India only equate longevity and branding with repetition, and personally, I feel that’s very limiting to the industry in general.” Bhansali feels like the criticism is just as linked to personal preference; especially in the context of fashion. “It’s tricky because people will often critique from the perspective of ‘Would I wear this or not?’ However customer bases are diverse, and criticism has to account for that. As a critic you need to be able to account for craftsmanship and originality that goes beyond the bounds of your preferences–and see if someone is innovating from point of view or not.” From a design POV, Goyal has a hold on a formula that works. “Maintaining a visual language for a label while also trying to do something new can be challenging, but it is possible with careful planning and execution. We often introduce new elements or techniques that complement the existing visual language, rather than completely overhauling it. That overhaul can be make-or-break.” Designer thinks the right sounding boards can make all the difference. “From a designer’s POV, the broad aesthetic or design language never really changes; it simply evolves as we attain more clarity.” For him, only a small group of people exists whose opinions he values and always considers, but in the end, it has to come from within. ”The best way for me is to work with interesting minds; stylists, and other creatives to present the same brand offerings through another lens. It might be the same shirt and trousers, but it’s completely new when paired differently. I feel like designers who push too hard, too often, also burnout sooner. Enjoy the ride, let it all flow; if they don’t like it now, they might love it later.”",entertainment

Marnus Labuschagne Makes Strong Case for ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 Squad After His Match-Winning Knock in SA vs AUS 1st ODI 2023,"Bloemfontein, Sep 8: Australia batter Marnus Labuschagne issued a timely reminder to the selectors with his Player of the Match performance against South Africa, coming as a substitute player, after her mother correctly predicted that her son would play in first ODI against the Proteas. Labuschagne, who was surprisingly left out of Australia's World Cup squad earlier this month, but got a chance to show his wares when he came in as a concussion substitute, replacing Cameron Green, and played a match-winning knock of 80 off 93 to guide his side to victory. Marnus Labuschagne Replaces Cameron Green As Concussion Sub After the Latter Retires Hurt Getting Hit By Kagiso Rabada's Bouncer During SA vs AUS 1st ODI 2023 (Watch Video) Green was hit behind the left ear when he went on to duck Kagiso Rabada's 140kph-plus ball which angled in from the off stump. Cricket Australia confirmed he had a precautionary scan and will now enter an eight-day concussion protocol where he will be monitored daily by the medical staff. ""She stayed for the whole game … she was adamant when I came here that I was going to play this game and I told her 'I've seen the team, mum, I'm not in the team'. She just had a feeling, and once again she's right,"" Labuschagne said after the match as quoted by cricket.com.au. The 29-year-old was initially preparing for the 50-over matches against New Zealand A in Queensland, which starts this week. However, he got a call-up as a replacement for Steven Smit, who suffered a wrist tendon injury, as cover of the South Africa series. ""It comes (down) to your training, I always pride myself on training well, and making sure I'm always ready. The opportunity that happens when you're a concussion sub is sometimes a little bit of a free hit because the pressure of the game is out there but obviously the expectation is probably not as much on you,"" he said. While Labuschagne is still hoping he can play a part in Australia's World Cup campaign in India, he knows a lack of runs in 50-over cricket gave selectors no option but to leave him out of their initial plans. 'Concussion Substitute Legend' Fans React After Marnus Labuschagne Plays Match-Winning Knock Replacing Injured Cameron Green During SA vs AUS 1st ODI 2023 ""I have been really disappointed with how I've played my one-day cricket, the last 10 to 12 games I felt like I haven't shown the intensity and the courage that I would have liked. I wasn't too shocked when I when I was dropped, I said that to the selectors (that) 'I understand, I haven't made runs'. When I came back from the Ashes, I went back to the drawing board and really thought about what I wanted to improve in my one-day game. I still want to be that person batting in the middle-order, and you've just got to sit tight and wait for your opportunity and when it comes, you've got to be ready,"" Labuschagne said.

Feeling Bloated After A Big Meal? Say Hello To Saunf Elachi Churan,"If you thought no meal is complete without dessert, then trust us, you missed out on something! You skipped mentioning the mouth fresheners. We believe a meal seems complete when you have a refreshing paan or some delicious sweet-and-sour digestives at the end. Some keep it simple and chew a spoonful of saunf or ajwain. These common spices have been on our dining tables since time immemorial. Saunf (or fennel seeds) is a storehouse of nutrients that not only adds a layer of aroma to our meals but also benefits our health in multiple ways - one such benefit is aiding digestion. Hence, we have brought you a delicious churan recipe that is not only refreshing but also includes ingredients, alongside saunf, that boost digestion. But before delving into the recipe, let's learn more about the goodness of saunf. - Saunf is a diuretic in nature and helps remove toxins from the body. - Saunf contains volatile oils like estragole, fenchone, and anethole that speed up the metabolism and digestion process in the body and promote the production of gastric enzymes. - The volatile oils in saunf also have a cooling effect, reducing the heat in your gut produced after meal consumption. - Saunf contains various antioxidants that help reduce oxidative stress and prevent fat accumulation in the body. - Saunf possesses anti-microbial properties that help eliminate food odours from the mouth and prevent bad breath. Also Read: End Your Meal Right! Keep This Homemade Mouth Freshener And Digestive Handy Photo Credit:iStock Saunf is the key ingredient for making the churan, as you now know the rationale behind it. Next, we add green cardamom (elaichi) to the recipe for its carminative effect. For the uninitiated, the essential oil menthone in this spice helps alleviate acidity, indigestion, and bloating post-meal. We then incorporate some dhana dal (roasted coriander seeds) and ajwain into the recipe for their anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties. Both these ingredients contain nutrients that aid in nutrient absorption from food, facilitate digestion, and eliminate bad breath . The recipe is super simple. Start by roasting saunf, ajwain, and cardamom to activate their essential oils. Then transfer the churan to a blender, add dhana dal to it, and grind. Dhana dal can be added directly as it comes pre-roasted. We prefer it coarsely ground for its crunch, but you can always blend it into a smooth powder. You can consume it raw or mix it with some lukewarm water and drink it. Click here for the detailed recipe. Note: While we prefer the churan as is for its natural flavours and aroma, you can always enhance it by adding some rock salt and lime juice to the powder for added flavours.",health

Revolutionising Investment Landscape: How Zero-Cost Brokerage Redefined The Game,"By Tajinder Virk The dynamic nature of the global financial markets is often narrated through captivating anecdotes, where seemingly inconsequential events trigger seismic shifts across the worldwide markets. At times, these shifts result in utter chaos, but more often they are manageable. Such inherent unpredictability contributes to greater risk in the world of capital investments. In the midst of these turbulent waters, the exorbitant commissions levied by brokerage service providers in the name of enabling investments end up siphoning away a significant chunk of potential returns. The practice of paying brokerage fees has for long been embedded in the investment landscape. However, in a world where investors shoulder the very risks linked to their chosen investments, the notion of brokers claiming a slice of these investments as facilitation fees is increasingly coming under scrutiny. Any form of taxation, whether it's a stamp duty on real estate transactions or brokerage charges on stock trades, is usually unwelcome on part of the party paying the tax. Brokerage fees are not different, practically being a tax on investment capital, a major roadblock in the investment journey of numerous traders that dilutes potential gains and inadvertently dampens investor enthusiasm. In the grand scheme, this business model becomes self-defeating: as traders engage in more frequent trading, brokers reap short-term benefits while traders suffer prolonged losses. This leads to an unsustainable cost structure to retain traders or investors, eventually driving them away from the capital markets. This underscores the detrimental effects of excessive brokerage charges, discouraging active participation and undermining the long-term stability of the financial ecosystem. A Paradigm Shift Through Technological Advancements The financial markets landscape has undergone a monumental transformation with the rise of technology, introducing discount brokers and zero-cost trading platforms that render capital market investments enticing for retail investors. The rationale behind tech-driven brokerage firms offering zero-cost services is strikingly straightforward. For example, sending messages on platforms like WhatsApp does not incur any extra charges. Brokers essentially function as the transmitters of the ‘execution messages’ on exchange servers, which makes brokerage fees completely impractical from both a technological and cost standpoint, since these processes are remarkably analogous. The exorbitant charges exacted by brokers warrant meticulous examination. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); As time has progressed, investors have increasingly questioned the logic behind these fees, particularly as alternative platforms emerge that offer comparable services without the cumbersome financial burden. As the investment landscape evolves, it is imperative to reassess the basis for these fees and explore strategies to harmonise them with the prevailing technological and economic realities. The Toll of Broking Charges Imagine a scenario where an individual engages in day trading, which is subject to brokerage and clearing fees. Further to this, let's assume this investor maintains a portfolio of Rs 10 Lakh and conducts one trade per day at a 10X leverage rate (typical for intraday or derivatives trading). Now let’s get to the financials part. The user pays a discount broker an average of Rs 100 in commissions and clearing fees for every Rs 1 Crore transaction, whether buying or selling with 10X leverage. Consequently, the total yearly cost sums up to Rs 200, spanning commissions, clearing charges, and administrative or ticket fees. With an average of 252 trading days annually, the investor faces about Rs 50,000 in annual brokerage and clearing charges. Remarkably, this amounts to nearly 5 per cent of the investor's portfolio being relinquished to the broker solely for accessing the trading platform. Compared to this, the interest earned by depositing the same amount in a bank account surpasses the brokerage expenses incurred. While factoring in the additional risks intrinsic to the stock market, the returns may not outweigh the exorbitant brokerage costs for a considerable portion of investors. With a 50 per cent chance of each investment being profitable, investors may find redirecting their funds from the capital markets to banks increasingly appealing. The Dawn of Zero-Cost Broking The zero-cost broking concept arose from a thought-provoking query: if the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is freely accessible, why should traders bear the brunt of brokerage costs when transmitting messages about financial exchange protocols? Leveraging technological platforms, broking firms can operate with minimal overheads, negating the necessity for high fees. As a consequence, discount brokers can enable trading anytime, anywhere through user-friendly smartphone apps. With growing awareness of the impact of excessive fees on investment returns, investors are seeking alternatives that offer transparent and cost-effective solutions. The acceptance of online trading and investment platforms has been accelerated by events like the Covid pandemic, prompting new investors to enter the stock market, driven by the prospect of supplemental income. Ushering In a New Era The rise of online discount brokerages has revolutionised the traditional brokerage industry, providing investors with a cost-efficient option. These platforms harness advanced technologies, such as sophisticated trading algorithms and intuitive interfaces, to offer seamless trading experiences at substantially lower costs compared to traditional full-service brokers. Investors can access real-time market data, execute trades, and manage portfolios with ease through user-friendly online platforms and mobile applications. The elimination of excessive fees, coupled with the convenience of technological advancements, has democratised investing, thereby attracting a wider range of investors and reshaping the industry. Discount brokerages empower individuals to take charge of their investments and participate in the financial markets with greater accessibility and affordability. As investors continue to incline towards zero-brokerage platforms, it wouldn’t be an overstatement to say that democratising investments is the way to go to ensure a prosperous future for markets and their stakeholders.

According to several reports, the joint infrastructure deal could be announced during the G20 summit in New Delhi, to be held on September 9-10. According to an Axios report on Thursday, the project is one of the key initiatives US President Biden is pushing in the Middle East to counter China's influence in the region. Notably, the Middle East is a key part of China's Belt and Road vision. Reports citing US officials involved in talks said that the project will connect Arab countries in the Levant and the Gulf via a network of railways that will also connect to India through seaports in the Gulf.

When Shah Rukh Khan Revealed The REAL Reason Behind Not Visiting Kashmir: 'My Father Told Me...',"Shah Rukh Khan is currently basking in the success of his film Jawan, which was released in theatres one day ago on Thursday. However, even before the film was released, its high-density advanced bookings proved that Jawan frenzy had engulfed the country. The film’s initial shows were completely sold out in many parts of the country, including Kashmir. However, the actor once said that he has never visited Kashmir for a special, heartwarming reason. In an earlier appearance on Amitabh Bachchan’s Kaun Banega Crorepati, Shah Rukh revealed why he had never visited Kashmir. He said, “My father’s mother was Kashmiri. To unhone (father) mujhe zindagi mein bola tha teen jagah zaroor dekhna life mein, main rahun ya naa rahun. Ek Istanbul zaroor dekhna, ek Italy main Rome zaroor dekhna aur ek Kashmir hai zaroor dekhna. Lekin baaki do mere bina bhi dekh lena par Kashmir mere bina mat dekhna. (My father told me that in life, make sure you visit Istanbul, Rome and Kashmir at least once, whether I’m here or not. However, you can visit the other two without me, but don’t go to Kashmir without me)."" He added, “So he died very early. I have been all over the world lekin main Kashmir kabhi nahi gaya. Bohot saare mauke bhi mile, doston ne bohot bulaya, ghar wale chutti pe bhi gaye, par main Kashmir kabhi nahi gaya. Kyunki mere father ne kaha tha ki Kashmir mere bina mat dekhna, Kashmir main dikhaaunga.” (I had a lot of opportunities, my friends also called me over and my family even went there for a holiday. However, I never went to Kashmir because my father said that I shouldn’t go there without him, as he would take me)."" Some netizens pointed out that Shah Rukh had been to Kashmir to film Jab Tak Hai Jaan. One person wrote, “Dunno what was the date of this KBC episode but he did visit Kashmir with Yash Chopra when he was doing JTHJ shooting there back in 2011-12. He shot in Ladakh, Gulmarg, Pahalgam, next to Pangong Lake, Yousmarg, Moor Plains in Leh, etc."" However, others said that while Shah Rukh couldn’t go to Kashmir with his father, he went there with his “father figure"" Yash Chopra. It was also reported this year that Shah Rukh has shot for his upcoming film Dunki in Kashmir. Directed by Rajkumar Hirani, Dunki will also star Taapsee Pannu in the lead. The film will mark Shah Rukh and Taapsee’s first pairing on screen. The film is scheduled to release in December this year.",entertainment
Kartik Aaryan And Anurag Basu's Aashiqui 3 To Commence Shoot In 2024; More Details Inside,"Whether it was Aashiqui in 1990 or its sequel in 2013, the films were widely loved by all. And while fans are eagerly waiting for Aashiqui 3, it looks like there is an interesting update about the movie that will be headlined by our very own Desi heartthrob Kartik Aaryan. Amid all the rumours and speculations on its release date and the leading actress, producer Bhushan Kumar has revealed the tentative month they’ll be going on floors. While speaking with IndiaToday.In, Bhushan Kumar shared the exciting update. He told the portal, “Hopefully, we will start Anurag Basu and Kartik Aaryan’s film by the end of January.” Additionally, Bhushan Kumar also informed that the Aashiqui 3’s pre-production is already underway and the composers are mindfully working on churning out memorable melodies like previous two movies. The third part of Anurag Basu’s musical Aashiqui will be headlined by Kartik Aaryan and if recent reports are to be believed, the makers have finalised the leading lady of the film too. Reportedly, Akanksha Sharma is likely to be finalised for the film. “Akanksha has had multiple meetings with the makers of the film and there is a possibility that things might get locked,” a source cited by E-Times claimed. “Akanksha is a fresh new face and makers of ‘Aashiqui’ have always looked out for fresh pairings; be it Rahul Roy and Anu Agarwal or Shraddha Kapoor and Aditya Roy Kapur,"" the insider added. Akanksha Sharma has predominantly worked in the Kannada industry. She also shared the screen space with Tiger Shroff earlier for the music video ‘Disco 82’. The first ever Aashiqui starring Rahul Roy and Anu Aggarwal in the lead hit theatres in July 1990. The sequel of the movie was headlined by Aditya Roy Kapur and Shraddha Kapoor. It was released in April 2013. Kartik Aaryan announced the third part of the franchise in September 2022 i.e. just after the success of his Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2. Later, talking to Variety about Aashiqui 3, Kartik said, “The timeless classic Aashiqui is something I grew up watching and working on Aashiqui 3 is like a dream come true. I feel privileged yet grateful collaborating with Bhushan Kumar and Mukesh Bhatt for this opportunity. I’ve been a big fan of Anurag Basu’s work and collaborating with him on this one will definitely shape me in many ways.” In June this year, Aditya Roy Kapoor also reacted to Kartik replacing him for Anurag Basu’s musical and shared that he is really looking forward for the movie. “Kartik and Fatima, is it? I mean when I first heard of it people asked me if I wanted to be a part of it. In the second film, I took a long swim, so I don’t think my character can return for a sequel. I think the team that they are putting together, from what we are hearing, is a great team. And I am really looking forward to it as a film watcher to see what they do with the next part,” he said as quoted by Indian Express. Reportedly, Aashiqui 3 is currently in the pre-production stage. Its release date has not been announced as of now.",entertainment

G20: World Bank Lauds India's Transformative Impact Of Digital Public Infra,"The World Bank has praised India's transformative impact of Digital Public Infrastructures (DPIs) in the past decade under the Narendra Modi-led government. As part of the G20 Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion the World Bank prepared a document and highlighted the steps taken by the Centre and the pivotal role of government policy and regulation in shaping the DPI landscape. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday tweeted about the World Bank’s G20 document where the global agency lauded India’s leap in financial inclusion. India's leap in financial inclusion, powered by Digital Public Infrastructure! A G20 document prepared by the @WorldBank shared a very interest point on India's growth. India has achieved financial inclusion targets in just 6 years which would otherwise have taken at least 47… — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) September 8, 2023 googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); The report stated about India’s standout achievements and rapid progress in financial inclusion. The Jan Dhan Yojana (JAM) Trinity, comprising the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), Aadhaar, and mobile numbers, has played a pivotal role in increasing financial inclusion rates. In six years, India has catapulted its financial inclusion rate from 25 per cent in 2008 to over 80 per cent of adults, the report mentioned. World Bank paper has also lauded the lower cost of compliance for banks for KYC. This monumental leap shortened the journey towards financial inclusion by up to 47 years, a feat primarily attributed to the influence of DPIs, according to World Bank. “While DPIs’ role in this leapfrogging is undoubtable, other ecosystem variables and policies that build on the availability of DPIs were critical. These included interventions to create a more enabling legal and regulatory framework, national policies to expand account ownership, and leveraging Aadhaar for identity verification,” the document states. India's DPI has not only transformed the public sector but has also enhanced efficiency for private organisations. Some Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) reported an 8 per cent higher conversion rate in SME lending, a 65 per cent reduction in depreciation costs, and a 66 per cent decrease in costs related to fraud detection. The document mentioned the phenomenal success of India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI) with over 9.41 billion transactions valued at about Rs 14.89 trillion taking place in May 2023 alone. For the fiscal year 2022–23, the total value of UPI transactions nearly reached 50 per cent of India's nominal GDP. The UPI-PayNow interlinking between India and Singapore, operationalised in February 2023, has facilitated faster, cheaper, and more transparent cross-border payments in line with the G20's financial inclusion priorities.",business
Aamir Khan Spent Time In Mumbai Slums To Perfect The Role of A Tapori In Ram Gopal Varma's Rangeela,"One of Aamir Khan’s most-loved performances Rangeela turns 28 today. Over the years, he has taken on diverse roles, each characterized by an unmatched dedication to authenticity and precision.

To prepare for his role as Munna, a street-smart and flamboyant tapori, Aamir didn’t rely solely on scripts and rehearsals. He decided to go the extra mile – quite literally. The actor spent considerable time immersing himself in the culture of Mumbai’s slums. He mingled with real-life taporis, observing their mannerisms, language, and lifestyle up close. It wasn’t just about mastering the dialogues; it was about understanding the very essence of the character he was about to portray. That apart, he didn’t want his character’s dialogues to sound rehearsed or artificial. Instead, he aimed for authenticity, and his efforts bore fruit. Munna’s dialogues flowed naturally, as if he had grown up on the streets of Mumbai himself. Even after all these years, Munna remains etched in the hearts of Bollywood enthusiasts. Aamir Khan’s performance in this film is a testament to his versatility as an actor. From the tapori’s quirks to his emotional depth, Aamir brought it all to life with finesse.

Reliance Partners With Nvidia To Create India's Own Generative-AI LLM: What It Means,"In a move aimed at bolstering the national industrial sector, Reliance Industries and Nvidia have unveiled a strategic collaboration to create India's very own large language model, tailored for generative AI applications and capable of accommodating the country's diverse languages. The two corporate giants will collaborate to construct AI infrastructure that surpasses the computing capabilities of India's fastest supercomputer by more than tenfold. Nvidia will provide access to its cutting-edge technology, including the Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip and the Nvidia DGX Cloud — an AI supercomputing service hosted in the cloud. The GH200 Superchip represents a fundamental breakthrough in computing architecture, offering remarkable performance and unparalleled memory bandwidth. This Nvidia-powered AI infrastructure will lay the groundwork for Reliance Jio Infocomm, the telecommunications arm of Reliance Industries, to explore new frontiers in AI. The global AI revolution is reshaping industries and daily life, and to harness India's vast potential in AI, Reliance will develop AI applications and services for its 450 million Jio customers. Furthermore, they will offer energy-efficient AI infrastructure to scientists, developers, and startups across India. AI has the potential to enable rural farmers to access weather information and crop prices in their local languages via mobile phones. It can facilitate large-scale expert medical diagnosis based on symptoms and imaging scans in areas where immediate access to doctors may be limited. Additionally, AI can enhance the prediction of cyclonic storms using decades of atmospheric data, thereby aiding timely evacuations and shelter finding for those at risk. The AI infrastructure will be hosted in AI-ready data centres, with plans to expand to a staggering 2,000 MW. Execution and implementation will be overseen by Jio, leveraging its extensive expertise in mobile telephony, 5G spectrum, fibre networks, and more. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, expressed enthusiasm for the partnership, stating, ""We are delighted to partner with Reliance to build state-of-the-art AI supercomputers in India. India has scale, data, and talent. With the most advanced AI computing infrastructure, Reliance can build its own large language models that power generative AI applications made in India, for the people of India."" Reliance Jio's broad expertise, infrastructure, and engineering capabilities make it well-suited to deploy and manage the new AI computing infrastructure. This collaboration with Nvidia is aligned with its strategy of becoming a comprehensive digital, cloud, and networking platform for both consumers and business customers. Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries, emphasised the significance of the partnership, stating, ""As India advances from a country of data proliferation to creating technology infrastructure for widespread and accelerated growth, computing and technology super centres like the one we envisage with Nvidia will provide the catalytic growth just like Jio did to our nation’s digital march."" Akash Ambani, Chairman of Reliance Jio Infocomm, echoed this sentiment, saying, ""At Jio, we are committed to fueling India’s technology renaissance by democratising access to cutting-edge technologies, and our collaboration with Nvidia is a significant step in this direction. Together, we will develop a state-of-the-art AI cloud infrastructure that is secure, sustainable, and deeply relevant across India, accelerating the nation’s journey towards becoming an AI powerhouse.""",business
Reliance Said to Be Exploring Foray Into Chip Manufacturing; in Talks With Potential Partners,"Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Industries has begun exploring a foray into manufacturing, a move that could address its supply chain needs and cater to growing chip demand in India, two people familiar with its strategy said. The telecoms-to-energy conglomerate, encouraged by the Indian government, has held early-stage talks with foreign chipmakers that have the potential to become technology partners, said one of the people who has direct knowledge of the plans. ""There is intent, there is no timeline,"" said the person, adding that Reliance has ""yet to make a call on whether they want to ultimately invest."" The names of the foreign chipmakers could not be immediately learned. The sources were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified. Reliance, whose interest in making semiconductors has not been previously reported, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. India's IT ministry and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's office also did not respond to requests for comment. Modi has declared he wants his country to become a chipmaker for the world but those ambitions, first laid out in 2021, have suffered setbacks. The country does not as yet have any chip manufacturing plants, although India's Vedanta and Taiwan's Foxconn are both looking at building facilities. Reliance sees merit in getting into semiconductors as the move would help safeguard against chip shortages that could affect its telecom and electronic devices businesses, the sources said. In 2021, for example, the conglomerate delayed the launch of a low-cost smartphone it was developing with Google citing the chip shortage. Demand for semiconductors in India and globally is also increasing, they noted. India's government has forecast the domestic chip market will be worth $80 billion (nearly Rs. 6,64,200 crore) by 2028 compared with $23 billion (nearly Rs. 1,90,960 crore) currently. Reliance, which has a market capitalisation of around $200 billion (nearly Rs. 16,60,530 crore), would be one the best-positioned companies in India to delve into semiconductors, said Arun Mampazhy, a former India executive at US-based chipmaker GlobalFoundries. ""They also have deep pockets and know how to work with the government,"" he said. But chip manufacturing is an industry that has historically been beset with boom and bust cycles and requires much expertise. ""Getting a tech partner – as a joint venture, or via transfer of technology, is the make or break point"" for Reliance, said Mampazhy. Setbacks for India's chip ambitions have come despite the government's offer of $10 billion (nearly Rs. 83,030 crore) in incentives. A $19.5 billion (nearly Rs. 1,61,930 crore) venture between Vedanta and Foxconn collapsed in July even before it got off the ground as the two sides struggled to find a tech partner, with Foxconn complaining that the project had not moved fast enough. Foxconn has since decided to invest in India without Vedanta. Plans by ISMC, a venture between Abu Dhabi-based Next Orbit Ventures and Israel's Tower Semiconductor, to invest $3 billion (nearly Rs. 24,900 crore) in India, have moved slowly after Intel sought to acquire Tower. Talks between Intel and Tower later collapsed. Reliance has for months been considering an investment of $300 million (nearly Rs. 2,490 crore) that would give it a 30 percent stake in the venture, a third source with direct knowledge of discussions said. Next Orbit Ventures and Tower did not respond to requests for comment. For the latest and , follow Gadgets 360 on , , and . For the latest videos on gadgets and tech, subscribe to our .",technology
Exposure to air pollution linked with lower birth weight in babies: Study,"Exposure to air pollution , even at relatively low levels, is associated with women giving birth to smaller babies, according to a study. The research, to be presented at the European Respiratory Society International Congress in Milan, Italy from September 9-13, also shows that women living in greener areas give birth to bigger babies and this may help counteract the effects of pollution. There is a strong relationship between birthweight and lung health, with low birthweight children facing a higher risk of asthma and higher rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) as they grow older, the researchers said. There is a need to reduce air pollution and make towns and cities greener to help protect babies and their developing lungs from potential harm, they said. Also Read | For an expanse of blue, with air so clean The study was based on data from the Respiratory Health in Northern Europe (RHINE) study and presented by Robin Mzati Sinsamala, a researcher at the University of Bergen (UiB), Norway. It included 4,286 children and their mothers living in five European countries -- Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland and Estonia. The researchers gauged the greenness of the areas where the women were living during pregnancy by measuring the density of vegetation on satellite images. This vegetation includes forests and farmland as well as parks in urban areas. They also used data on five pollutants: nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone, black carbon, and two types of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10). The average levels of air pollution were within European Union standards. Explained | Is air pollution driving the rise of antibiotic resistance? Researchers compared this information with the babies’ birthweights, taking account of factors that are known to affect birthweight, such as mother's age, whether the mothers smoked or had any other health conditions. They found that higher levels of air pollution were linked with lower birthweights, with small particulate matter PM2.5, relatively bigger pollution particles PM10, NO2 and black carbon associated with average reductions in birth weight of 56, 46, 48 and 48 grammes, respectively. When researchers took greenness into account, the effect of air pollution on birthweight was reduced. Women who lived in greener areas had babies with slightly higher birth weight -- 27 grammes heavier on average -- than mothers living in less green areas. ""The time when babies are growing in the womb is critical for lung development. We know that babies with lower birthweight are susceptible to chest infections, and this can lead on to problems like asthma and COPD later on,"" Sinsamala said. ""Our results suggest that pregnant women exposed to air pollution, even at relatively low levels, give birth to smaller babies. They also suggest that living in a greener area could help counteract this effect,"" the researcher added. The team noted that it could be that green areas tend to have lower traffic or that plants help to clear the air of pollution, or green areas may mean it is easier for pregnant women to be physically active.",environment
"""Why Rahul All Time..."": Ex-India Star Name-Drops 'Kohli, Rohit' In Debate","Former India batter Aakash Chopra has opened up on the Rohit Sharma -led side's fascination over KL Rahul , who hasn't been in the best of forms so far this year. Rahul, who missed the two group matches of the Asia Cup, is likely to be back for the Super 4 game against Pakistan on Sunday. He is also included in India's 15-man preliminary squad for the World Cup on home soil, starting October 5. However, several current and former players suggested that India should continue to back the in-form players, instead of Rahul, who has been out of action for a while. Chopra pointed out that Rahul is a flexible player, who can vat at different positions and can also keep the wickets, which makes his one of the first names in the playing XI. ""It has been a topic of intense debate that why KL Rahul all the time - why does the Indian team remain so interested? Although he is an opener, he is among the very few versatile cricketers who can bat in other positions and are equally adept,"" Chopra said in a video on his YouTube channel. To further back his claim, Chopra gave the examples of star batter Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli , who are unlikely to change their batting slots. ""You can take it with a pinch of salt, if you may, you will not ask Rohit Sharma to play at No. 5. You have less expectation of Virat Kohli performing very well at No. 5. Although both of them have done it in the past, now the best of them is at the top. You won't ask Shubman Gill to play at No. 5. In fact, you are slightly 50-50 in playing Ishan Kishan as well at No. 5 because he won't get to bat in the first 10 overs every time and what will happen if spin comes straightaway at the start. What happens if the pitch is slightly slow? So those questions are still on your mind,"" Chopra explained. Rahul was seen practising in the the nets ahead of the game against Pakistan on Sunday. It will be interesting to see whether or not he'll be shipped straight into the playing XI.",sports
"""When We Meet Series To Series..."": Rohit On His Camaraderie With Kohli","Ahead of their Asia Cup Super 4 match against arch-rivals Pakistan, India captain Rohit Sharma has opened up on his equation with former skipper Virat Kohli and head coach Rahul Dravid .

Under Rohit, India reached the semi-final of the T20 World Cup last year, and also made it to the final of the World Test Championship, where they lost to Australia this year. During a recent interaction, Rohit revealed that he and Kohli always have a detailed discussion of the opposition team(s) and its players, prior to a series or a big tournament. ""During the batting, it's about what the bowler is bowling and the conditions. When we meet series to series, we discuss regarding the opposition players. What to do and what not,"" Rohit told senior journalist Vimal Kumar during an interview. Rohit also opened up on his admiration for Rahul, having made his debut under his captaincy back in 2007. ""I have a huge respect for him (Rahul Dravid) for what he is as a person firstly and then obviously as a cricketer. It's because you need to be a good person first and then a cricketer, footballer, doctor, etc,"" said Rohit. The 36-year-old also revealed Dravid's basic rule as head coach. ""I made my debut under him, though, I didn't play long. He doesn't like any communication gap with any player or support staff. His first rule is to communicate,"" Rohit revealed.",sports
"""Score Loads Of Runs With..."": Yuvraj's Special Birthday Post For Gill","Team India's batting sensation Shubman Gill turned 24 on Friday. Fans as well as several current and former cricketers took to social media to wish Gill on his special day. Gill, who made his international debut in 2019, is known for his elegant stroke-making. He is now considered as the successor of current Indian batting great, Virat Kohli . He is also India's youngest all-format centurion. As Gill celebarted his 24th birthday on Friday, the cricketing fraternity extended its wishes to one of India's finest prospects. Former India all-rounder Yuvraj Singh , who was part of the World Cup-winning side in 2011, wished Gill and also congratulated him on being part of the Indian team for ODI World Cup on home soil later this year. ""Happy birthday Gill sahab. congratulations on the World Cup call-up! Hope you score loads of runs with your mighty bat and your even mightier determination. god bless, lots of love @ShubmanGill,"" Yuvraj captioned a photo of him and Gill on X. Happy birthday Gill sahab congratulations on the World Cup call-up! Hope you score loads of runs with your mighty bat and your even mightier determination god bless, lots of love @ShubmanGill pic.twitter.com/6LU2ptUD6W Overall in 58 international matches, he has scored 2,784 runs at an average of 43.50, with seven centuries and 12 half-centuries in 73 innings and the best score of 208. With his sheer consistency, he is going towards the path of becoming a future all-time great in world cricket. Shubman Gill has represented Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and Gujarat Titans (GT) in the Indian Premier League. In 91 matches, he has scored 2,790 runs at an average of 37.70 and a strike rate of 134.07, with three centuries and 18 fifties. His best score is 129. Gill was the part of GT's debut IPL campaign in which they won the title. With 483 runs in 16 matches at an average of 34.50, with four fifties, he was one of the architects of this win. In the next season this year, Gill stepped up his game massively. In 17 matches, he scored 890 runs at an average of 59.33 and a strike rate of 157.80, with three centuries four fifties and a best score of 129 in 17 innings. His knocks helped his team reach finals and he became the youngest 'Orange Cap' winner for most runs in IPL history, at the age of just 23. Gill also has the second-highest runs in a single IPL season with 890 runs, sitting next to Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) star Virat, who scored 973 runs in the 2016 season, with four centuries and seven fifties in 16 innings. Gill has a long way to go. But the accolades he accomplished in such a short time proves that the 'Prince of Indian Cricket' he is here for a long run. He will only get better with time and under the guidance of a superstar-filled Indian team, he will no doubt run this game for years to come. (With ANI Inputs)",sports
"""Not Ideal"": India-Pakistan Reserve Day Has Bangladesh Coach Disappointed","Sri Lanka coach Chris Silverwood and his Bangladesh counterpart Chandika Hathurasingha on Friday expressed displeasure over the unilateral decision to provide a reserve day for the Super 4 match between India and Pakistan. Earlier in the day, the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) announced that the Indo-Pak match could resume on September 11 if the rain plays spoilsport on September 10. However, the other matches will not have a reserve day though rain is predicted in the Sri Lankan capital through the Super 4s. Hathurasingha said he was not aware of the reason behind the sudden change in Asia Cup playing conditions. “There is a technical committee (in Asia Cup) represented by every participating country – 6 nations. They might have decided it for some other reason,” the Bangladesh coach said during the pre-match press conference ahead of their Super 4 match against Sri Lanka on Saturday. Hinting that no move was made to take a consensual call on the issue, Hathurasingha said his team also would have liked to have a reserve day. “It is not ideal, and we also would have liked to have an extra day,” he added. Hathurasingha also hinted that the officials concerned did not consult other teams before arriving at the decision. “But I don't have any more comment on this because they have already made a decision and had they consulted us earlier we would have given our opinion,” said Hathurasingha. Silverwood said he was surprised when conveyed about the decision to have an extra day for the Indo-Pak match. “Yeah! Look, obviously, I was a little surprised when I heard it first. But we don't organise the competition, so we can't do a whole lot about it, right?” asked Silverwood. The Lankan coach also said the reserve day could give a bit of an unfair advantage to either India or Pakistan if they manage to log in points on that particular day. “To be honest, I see it only becoming a problem if it provides points to the teams, and affects us,” said Silverwood.

"Stokes Likely To Undergo Knee Surgery Post WC, Could Miss India Tests","England's Test captain Ben Stokes in all likelihood will undergo knee surgery after the conclusion of ODI World Cup rendering him a doubtful starter for the important five-match away series against India next year. Once a premier all-rounder Stokes has found it hard to bowl this summer due to chronic tendonitis in his knee. He has mostly played as a specialist batter in the last three Ashes and will continue to do so in the ODI series against New Zealand followed by the World Cup in India next month. Stokes said he plans to sort out his long pending surgery post the World Cup but refused to divulge the details. ""I know what's going to happen, I just don't think now is right time to say what I'm doing,"" Stokes told reporters on Thursday ahead of the first ODI against New Zealand. ""I've been having some good conversations with some specialists. There is a plan in place. It's nice knowing after the World Cup we've got something, a really good plan we can do and we can stick to."" ""I want to be playing next summer as a genuine all-rounder. This winter is all about playing this World Cup, then getting this knee sorted,"" he added. If the England Test captain undergoes a surgery post the World Cup he could be in a race against time to get fit the five-Test series in India, starting January 25. Any player recuperating from knee surgery could take at least 8-12 weeks depending on the nature of the operation and time taken for extensive rehabilitation. With a million pound plus IPL contract in his kitty, the ideal time of return could well be the next year's IPL if one logically calculates the time he could take to start playing top flight cricket once again. Stokes returns to England's ODI set up after reversing his decision to retire from the format to play in the World Cup in India, starting October 5 with the summit clash slated for November 19. Comfortable with players turning down central contracts ================================== With T20 leagues mushrooming all across the world, players are increasingly opting out of their central contracts to to play franchise cricket. However, Stokes is comfortable with the players' decisions to opt for lucrative leagues. ""We've got to understand, and I've got to understand as a captain, that there might be some decisions players make and I'm very comfortable and aware that something like that might happen,"" Stokes said. ""But it's up to the individual and I think having a good and clear understanding that the landscape of cricket is changing in front of our eyes very quickly, makes things like this a bit more easy to understand, if players were to choose to do something like that,"" he concluded.",sports
Ex-Kings captain Brown to enter U.S. Hockey Hall,"COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -- Former NHL players Dustin Brown and Jamie Langenbrunner highlight the 2023 U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame class unveiled Friday by USA Hockey. Longtime executive Brian Burke, women's star Katie King Crowley and official Brian Murphy also are being inducted into the hall at a ceremony Dec. 6 in Boston. ""It's an amazing class and a group that truly reflects extraordinary,"" USA Hockey president Mike Trimboli said. ""Their accomplishments are varied and far-reaching, and the positive impact they've had on the game -- and will continue to have -- will no doubt benefit generations to come."" Brown in 2012 became the second American captain to hoist the Stanley Cup when the Los Angeles Kings won it for the first time, and he did it again in 2014. Earlier this year, the team put a statue of Brown outside of its arena and retired his No. 23 to the rafters. Langenbrunner also won the Cup twice, in 1999 with Dallas and 2003 with New Jersey. He was a teammate of Brown's at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics when the U.S. won the silver medal. King Crowley helped the U.S. win gold in 1998 in Nagano at the first Olympics with women's hockey. She has a silver medal from 2002 in Salt Lake City and a bronze from 2006 in Torino, and her 14 goals at the Olympics are tied for the most among U.S. national team players. Burke's vast career in hockey included time as an agent and a Stanley Cup championship with Anaheim as the Ducks' general manager in 2007. He was GM of the 2010 silver-medal-winning U.S. Olympic team and has also served in that role and as president of hockey operations for several U.S. clubs. Murphy is one of just eight officials -- and only two Americans -- to work over 2,000 regular-season NHL games. He officiated nine Stanley Cup Finals and is one of the rare officials to serve as a referee and a linesman.",sports
"Jones: Not SB or bust, but Cowboys chasing title","FRISCO, Texas -- In January, Dallas Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones dealt with the disappointment of another playoff loss to the San Francisco 49ers. As he enters his 35th season, Jones believes this year's Cowboys team is better than the one that ended last season. ""Some years going in, I've known that we were in better shape than others,"" Jones said in a conversation that will air on ESPN's ""Sunday NFL Countdown."" ""There are parts of this team that we're in as good shape as we've ever been in since I've been a Dallas Cowboy."" Ahead of the team's season opener Sunday against the New York Giants, Jones is not calling 2023 a Super Bowl-or-bust season. ""I feel strongly that we should aspire and, frankly, do anything at any time that can make us better right now to compete at that level,"" he said. ""I think I'm saying a lot when I say that. This isn't about years in the future. The good news is you can make the decisions that can help you right now first and foremost but can also be additive for the future. Those are the ones I'm looking for and trying to compromise on every day."" Jones continued to back Dak Prescott, who is entering his eighth year as the Cowboys' starting quarterback. Prescott has not gotten past the divisional round in four career playoff appearances as he tries to do what only Roger Staubach and Troy Aikman have done for Dallas. Asked what Prescott needs to show him to prove he is a Super Bowl quarterback, Jones said, ""I think that we first of all have to realize how few Super Bowls that even the greatest quarterbacks attain. And it's never too late to start. And so that if Dak should start this year with a Super Bowl and tack one or two more on, then he would be right there with the best that have ever played for the Dallas Cowboys."" Jones said he believes Prescott's play will improve in 2023 in part because coach Mike McCarthy is now calling plays, making tweaks to the only offense Prescott has run. McCarthy ""is going to have the benefit of [former OC Kellen Moore] but at the same time be able to really, I think, benefit from having seen these players play, having seen the pluses and minuses of what Kellen did as a playcaller,"" Jones said. ""I think all of those things will make us a better team now."" And what happens if the Cowboys do not win a Super Bowl this season, stretching their championship drought to 28 years? ""How we are as a team as we evolve through this season, all of that we'll weigh,"" Jones said. ""We could very easily have a team that doesn't hold the trophy up but be dramatically better than one that if you cleaned house. So we'll let that set of facts, [let] that play during this '23 year be the influencing things when we get to '24. ""You ask me, 'Is winning the Super Bowl imperative without blowing this team up?' And I say, no, it is not.""",sports
Germany ends USA's FIBA WCup run in semifinals,"MANILA, Philippines -- When Team USA assembled its roster and decided on its game plan for this World Cup cycle, it made a bet. It was a sensible bet, and the Americans stacked the deck as much as they could to try to win it, but the reality was they entered knowing they left themselves exposed. That wager -- that size differential could be overcome with other attributes -- has failed. Germany, another European team that towered over the Americans, used the given advantage and beat Team USA 113-111 in the world semifinals Friday. It will deny the Americans gold in the event for a second consecutive time. They will settle for playing for bronze Sunday (ESPN2, 4:45 a.m. ET) against Canada, which lost to Serbia in the day's other semifinal. The U.S. played a spirited and aggressive game. The team was just too small, and it showed up repeatedly, just as it did against Lithuania last weekend in the previous loss. ""They've got a lot of big strong guys,"" Team USA coach Steve Kerr said. ""They put a lot of stress on your defense and just give them credit, they outplayed us."" Germany was simply able to get more chances to score because it often was able to get the ball back when it missed. The Germans pulled down 12 offensive rebounds, leading to 25 second-chance points (Team USA had eight). But they didn't miss that often. Point guard Dennis Schroder, when he's in a passing mood, was a weapon against the U.S. because he's skilled enough to handle its ball pressure. Combined with the German height advantage, it led to a flow of high-percentage looks. And that was not survivable. ""We got outrebounded all night,"" said guard Anthony Edwards, who had 23 points and tried to lead a late comeback. ""They were more physical than us."" The U.S. cut the lead to one in the final two minutes after Germany got up by as much as 12. But a 3-pointer by Andreas Obst, that last of his 24 points and four 3-pointers, held off the American charge. There were some mismatches created when the U.S. switched on screen-and-rolls. Packing the paint defensively to try to deal with the size issue led to the Germans getting some good looks from outside, and they absolutely made the U.S. pay, nailing 13 of 30 3-pointers. This led to Germany shooting a sizzling 58% overall and racking up 50 points in the paint. In addition to Schroder, who finished with 17 points, the German NBA big men feasted. Franz Wagner finished with 22 points and Daniel Theis had 21. ""If you give up 113 points in a 40-minute game, you're not going to win many of those,"" said Austin Reaves, who had 21 points. ""Anytime you lose sucks."" Kerr started small all tournament, going with Josh Hart at power forward and Jaren Jackson Jr. at center. Then he stayed small as he did all tournament, going with Paolo Banchero as a backup big man and leaving the only true center selected for the roster, Walker Kessler, out of the rotation. Under the correct circumstances, Team USA can and did win with this alignment. But one of those factors has to be an aggressive and fast-break-generating defense. But the margin for error was not feasible. Even with an extremely favorable draw that gave it travel and opponent advantages, there was just too much size to mitigate. Team USA played without Brandon Ingram, who missed the game with an upper respiratory illness. It was the first missed game in the tournament due to injury or illness for the team. Anthony Edwards led Team USA with 23 points and Mikal Bridges added 17. ""We're expected to win, I guess, year in and year out. We're expected to win just because of the history that USA basketball,"" said Jalen Brunson, who had 15 points and seven assists. ""We obviously didn't come to play ready to play from the start.""",sports
Prosecutors accuse Rubiales of sexual assault,"State prosecutors in Spain have filed a lawsuit against Luis Rubiales alleging sexual assault and coercion for kissing a player on the lips without her consent after the Women's World Cup final, the country's prosecutors' office said Friday. Rubiales, the now-suspended president of the Spanish football federation (RFEF), kissed Jenni Hermoso on the lips during the awards ceremony after Spain beat England to win the title on Aug. 20 in Sydney. Prosecutors presented a case against Rubiales to Spain's National Court in Madrid two days after Hermoso formally accused him of sexual assault. According to a sexual consent law passed last year, Rubiales could face a fine or a prison sentence of one to four years if found guilty of sexual assault. The new law eliminated the difference between ""sexual harassment"" and ""sexual assault,"" sanctioning any unconsented sexual act. Prosecutors added Friday that Rubiales could have committed an act of coercion when, according to Hermoso, he pressured her to speak out in his defense immediately after people criticized his behavior. Rubiales has insisted the kiss was consensual. Hermoso has denied that in statements issued by her and her players' union. Prosecutors have asked the judge that Rubiales appear before a court to give preliminary testimony. If the National Court judge agrees the hear the case, it would lead to a formal court investigation that will end with a recommendation for the case to either be dismissed or go to trial. Hermoso, 33, now plays for Mexican club Pachuca after a long career as a forward with top Spanish and European clubs, including Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid. She returned to her Mexican club on Thursday. Rubiales, 46, faces consequences other than a possible criminal trial. He was suspended from his post by FIFA on Aug. 27, a day after he refused to step down when he delivered a defiant speech to the general assembly of his federation in which he said he was victim of a ""witch hunt"" by ""false feminists."" Rubiales was banned from his post for 90 days while FIFA disciplinary judges consider his case. Football's governing body can impose sanctions on individuals ranging from warnings and fines to suspensions from the sport. Rubiales also faces action from the Spanish government. A government legal panel overseeing sports has opened a probe to determine if he abused his authority by kissing Hermoso or tainted the image of Spain with his conduct. He faces being deemed unfit to hold his post for up to two years. Rubiales' behavior at the final, which included a lewd crotch grab while next to dignitaries such as Spain's queen and infanta, combined with his controversial speech, have tarnished the Women's World Cup title and damaged his own federation. Spain's women's players have said they won't play again for their nation until big changes are made in the federation. The federation fired coach Jorge Vilda, but the players have yet to say if they consider that sufficient. The accusation by prosecutors against Rubiales came as players for Spain's women's league began their strike on the opening day of the competition after salary talks with the league broke down. The league, called Liga F, was one of the first football institutions to criticize Rubiales' conduct. Rubiales, a former player and former head of Spain's biggest players' union, has run the federation since 2018. He has boosted revenue and funding for lower-level football and the women's game, but his successes have sometimes been tinged with controversy. Rubiales revolutionised the Spanish Super Cup in 2019 by taking it to Saudi Arabia -- now the big draw for top European talent like Cristiano Ronaldo -- in exchange for $40 million a year. The move was criticised by women's and human rights groups because of the Saudi regime's treatment of women and minorities. Spanish authorities also scrutinised the deal, and an investigative judge is probing the legality of the Super Cup contracts. Rubiales increased his power by becoming a vice president of European football body UEFA, and was supposed to lead the bid by Spain, Portugal and Morocco to host the 2030 men's World Cup. Spain's government has since warned that the bid to host one of the world's biggest sporting events is at risk of being sullied.",sports
Aryna Sabalenka is ready for the fight in US Open final against Coco Gauff,"NEW YORK -- Aryna Sabalenka had just lost the first set in her semifinal match 6-0 against Madison Keys at the US Open on Thursday night, and she appeared stunned and defeated as she headed to her chair. The sweat dripped down her face. This was hardly how the soon-to-be crowned world No. 1 player was supposed to look. And it was a far cry from how she had played throughout the rest of the tournament. The 25-year-old and reigning Australian Open champion hadn't dropped a set -- nor more than five games in a match -- throughout her run before her clash with Keys. But on Thursday, Sabalenka, who has a tiger tattoo on her left arm, was lacking her signature roar. She was listless and unfocused during the deflating opening 30 minutes of play. On a night filled with the unexpected in Arthur Ashe Stadium, it was perhaps the most surprising sight of all. ""I was all over the place,"" Sabalenka said later. I was just, like, 'What can I do?' Like, she's playing unbelievable, just, like, crushing everything. I'm not able to do anything; I had zero control in the match. ""I just [kept] telling myself, I mean, 'OK, there is going to be days like this [where] somebody's going to just play their best tennis. You just have to keep trying, keep staying there and keep pushing it. Maybe you'll be able to turn around this game.'"" In the second set, Sabalenka was broken in the third game and then found herself trailing, 5-3. With one game standing between her and going home, Sabalenka raised her level and pounced on Keys' errors and every sign of nerves. She evened the score and ultimately forced a tiebreak. She won the tiebreak. And then, needing another tiebreak in the deciding set, she won the match. No matter that she thought she had won the match at 7-3, even beginning to celebrate; she found a way just a few minutes later. After two hours and 32 minutes, Sabalenka emerged victorious with the baffling scoreline, 0-6, 7-6 (1), 7-6 (5). She fell to her knees before standing and clutching her head in her hand. She became just the third woman in the Open Era to win a Grand Slam semifinal match after being bageled in the opening set. ""Somehow, I don't know how, I turned around the match,"" she told Rennae Stubbs on court, struggling to find the words to sum up what she had just done. During the 2022 US Open, Sabalenka was on the other side of a devastating semifinal loss, having won the opening set before falling to eventual champion Iga Swiatek. But she's a different player a year later-- and it showed. It's been a monumental stretch for Sabalenka since her exit in New York last September. She opened 2023 with the title at Adelaide and then won the first major of her career in Melbourne. Since then, she won the 1000-level title in Madrid, as well as playing in the finals at Indian Wells and Stuttgart, and became the first player since Serena Williams in 2016 to reach the semifinals in all four majors in the same season. Having spent almost the entirety of the year ranked at No. 2, she had been open about her childhood dream of taking over the world's top spot. She had come close to achieving it over the past several months but had been unable to catch Swiatek. She narrowed the gap as the season went on, and, entering the US Open, she simply needed to match or do better than Swiatek's final result. When Swiatek lost in the fourth round, Sabalenka then became the No. 1 in waiting, to be made official in the rankings released after the tournament. When speaking to the media the next day, she said she was happy about the milestone but wasn't really thinking about it just yet. ""I'm focusing on [the] US Open,"" Sabalenka said. ""I don't want to celebrate anything before the end of the US Open. So I just want to focus on this tournament more than on world No. 1."" Yet, despite her incredible year and her soon-to-be ranking, she's been somewhat under the radar during her time in New York. Her first three matches were played in Louis Armstrong Stadium, not Ashe, and her results have been overshadowed by other players and storylines. But now she's into the second Grand Slam final of her career and will take on American 19-year-old and fan favorite Coco Gauff on Saturday under the brightest of lights and on the biggest of stages. Keys had such a sizable lead by the time Gauff came to her news conference after her earlier match that there wasn't a single question even asked about a potential match against Sabalenka. But Gauff surely knows from their previous matches that it will be a challenge. The two have played five times previously, with Gauff winning three of those meetings, but with Sabalenka winning their most recent match, at Indian Wells in March, 6-4, 6-0. But now, because red-hot Gauff is riding a 17-1 win streak on the hardcourt this summer, and earned the titles in Cincinnati and Washington, D.C., Sabalenka said that last meeting means nothing in terms of her preparation. But if Thursday taught her anything, it's that she will be prepared to battle until the very last point. ""She [has] improved a lot [since then],"" Sabalenka said. ""So it's a different player. We don't like really thinking about that match. ""Going into this final, I think I just have to focus on myself and prepare myself for another fight. ... You just have to be there and you have to fight for it.""",sports
PM Modi's Degrees: Court Reserves Order on Kejriwal's Plea Against Summons in Defamation Case,"A sessions court here on Friday reserved its order on the pleas filed by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders Arvind Kejriwal and Sanjay Singh, challenging the summons issued to them by a local magistrate in a criminal defamation case over comments about Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s educational qualification. After hearing arguments from all the parties, Judge J M Brahmbhatt reserved the order for September 14. The court started hearing the matter on September 6, days after the Gujarat High Court asked the principal judge of the sessions court to assign a judge and said that it should be decided within ten days. Gujarat University has filed a complaint of `criminal defamation’ before a metropolitan magistrate here against Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal and AAP’s Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh over their “sarcastic and derogatory"" statements in connection with Modi’s degrees. During the hearing on September 6 and 8, the AAP leaders’ lawyers argued that the summoning order of the trial court was wrong and Gujarat University could not file a defamation case in this matter. No case was made out against the two leaders, they argued. The magistrate’s court, while summoning the two leaders, had observed that prima facie a case under section 500 (defamation) of the Indian Penal Code was made out. Gujarat University’s registrar Piyush Patel filed the complaint over Kejriwal and Singh’s comments after the Gujarat High Court set aside an order of the Chief Information Commissioner to provide information about Modi’s degrees to them under the Right To Information Act. The AAP leaders made defamatory statements intentionally in press conferences and on Twitter (now X) targeting the university, the complaint alleged. Their comments were defamatory, and sarcastic and hurt the prestige of the university, it claimed.",politics
Russian wished Griner 'good luck' during swap,"Russian Viktor Bout, the so-called Merchant of Death involved in a prisoner exchange for WNBA star Brittney Griner in December, says he followed Griner's case closely from federal prison in Illinois and learned he was being swapped for her when guards came to his cell with boxes early the morning of his release. In an exclusive interview with ESPN, Bout says he recalled hearing a knock on his cell door and being told, ""Hey, you know, wake up and pack up. You're leaving."" ""Then,"" Bout recalled, ""I realized, yes, I'm going home."" Bout, 56, and Griner, 32, were freed and returned to their respective countries Dec. 8, 2022, in a dramatic prisoner exchange on the tarmac of an airport in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Since his release, Bout has declared his support for Russian President Vladimir Putin and the invasion of Ukraine and has been nominated for a seat in a regional legislative assembly in central Russia. Elections there are Sunday. After her release, Griner returned to play for the WNBA's Phoenix Mercury, who host their final home game Friday against Las Vegas, then play their final game of the season Sunday afternoon at Las Vegas. The Mercury missed the playoffs this year, snapping the league's longest streak of 10 consecutive seasons. Russian authorities detained Griner at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport on Feb. 17, 2022, while she was traveling to Russia to play for club team UMMC Ekaterinburg. Customs officials found vape cartridges with oil derived from cannabis in her backpack. There was no public announcement of her arrest until March 5, 2022. Her plight unfolded at the same time Russia was invading Ukraine and further heightened tensions between Russia and the U.S. On July 7, 2022, Griner pleaded guilty to drug charges, saying she accidentally packed the vape cartridges. A Russian judge sentenced her to nine years in prison. Bout was serving a 25-year sentence at the United States Penitentiary in Marion, Illinois, after being convicted in 2011 on four felony counts, including conspiracy to kill Americans. Undercover agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration arrested Bout in a 2008 sting operation in Thailand. The U.S. agents had posed as Colombian rebels trying to buy millions of dollars' worth of weapons, which they said they would use to shoot down U.S. military aircraft. Asked about outrage in the U.S. over the crimes he was convicted of more than a decade ago versus what Griner was convicted of, Bout said: ""Well, think of this, that the same outrage was in Russia when I was sentenced to 25 years. Many people would say, 'For what? Just for talking? Are you serious?' ""There is not even a proper translation to Russian of the crime of conspiracy. We don't have such even the legal term, So, this is this same kind of outrage in Russia about my case and about many other cases."" Bout maintained that he never intended to sell weapons. According to prosecutors, when undercover U.S. agents told him the weapons would be used against U.S. pilots, Bout responded, ""We have the same enemy."" Bout said he identified in some ways with Griner and what she might have gone through at the time, saying, ""Of course, I feel, you know, bad or sorry for any person who's going to be used as a pawn, despite whether they committed something or not. ""Publicity is a, like, multiplying factor which can really kill you if you are not strong enough to handle it."" He said people like himself or Griner sometimes ""pay a price"" because politicians try to ""play chess, on this big chessboard which they call geopolitics."" Bout said he knew Griner had played for a Russian basketball team and won a Russian championship. He said that he followed developments in her case by watching coverage on CNN, ESPN and other U.S.-based networks while in prison and that he first heard that he might be involved in an exchange deal via news coverage. ""Look, I mean, in United States, I guess, only lazy would not, you know, cover her trial,"" he said. ""Every, you know, talking radio host, every news station, every TV channel on the news broadcast, so this was a big, big deal, I guess, you know, especially in jail."" At the Abu Dhabi airport, Bout said, he was handed over to Russian authorities as Griner went with U.S. officials. Upon seeing Griner, Bout said, he was surprised to see her without her signature hair -- she cut it while in prison to avoid it freezing during the winter. He said that Griner was ""way taller than me"" and that they shook hands on the tarmac. Russian video of the moment shows the two approaching each other, but it cuts away and does not show them shaking hands as they turn for their respective departures. ""So, I said, you know, 'I wish you good luck,'"" he said, ""and, you know, and we both went to our, you know, planes."" President Joe Biden authorized Bout's release. The exchange did not include Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine accused of spying and jailed in Russia since 2018. Bout said he agreed to speak with ESPN because he believes the U.S. and Russia ""have a common ground to at least have normal relation between our countries."" In April, during Griner's first news conference since her detainment in Russia, the WNBA All-Star spoke of her resilience and gratitude and of how she used humor to manage during her experience. The two-time Olympic gold medalist who has played professionally in Russia and China said she would not play internationally again unless it's for the U.S. national team. She also spoke of the need to raise awareness of other U.S. detainees overseas.",sports
Worldview with Suhasini Haidar | G-20 Summit | Key takeaways India will be looking for,"This week on WorldView- India’s G20 Moment is finally here- what do you need to know to get through the big weekend of India’s international diplomacy? So first, leaders have begun to arrive for the G20 summit- A grouping that represents around 85% of the global GDP, over 75% of the global trade, and about two-thirds of the world population This is the high point of India’s Presidency that began on December 1- while they are here for the meeting of the world’s top 20 economies- 19 countries and the EU, what is called the premier forum for global economic cooperation, many of them have other agendas too. 1. All G-7 members are set to attend at Head of State level- which means US President Biden, Canadian PM Trudeau, French President Macron, German Chancellor Scholz, Italian PM Melloni, Japanese PM Kishida, UK PM Sunak and the EU President Charles Michele and President of the European Commission Von der Leyen. -Of these PM Modi has held bilateral meetings, some more than once, with atleast 5, and has made trips to 4 countries. -Worth watching the meetings with Canadian PM Trudeau- with whom differences over separatist violence by Khalistani groups, and now a pause on the Free Trade Agreement Talks by the Trudeau government, and - British PM Sunak, the first UK PM of Indian origin, who is also discussing an FTA will be significant. 2. All Quad members will be here, and PM Modi will want to discuss India’s turn to host the Quad in 2024- sources say he would like them to come in January, and even perhaps to be chief guests at Republic Day- while they may not all be able to, remember Jan 26 is also Australia Day, that’s worth watching. -South Korean President Yeol is also coming 3. All BRICS members are in G20 too—and remember PM Modi has already been to South Africa a few weeks ago to attend the BRICS summit hosted by South African President Ramaphosa. However, Russian President Putin and Chinese President Xi will not attend the summit- sending Rusian FM Lavrov and Chinese Premier Li in their place respectively. Putin, who has missed the G20 for 3 yrs now called Modi to explain, but Xi Jinping has never missed except during Covid in 2021, when he attended virtually. The Chinese President no-show sends a clear signal about the state of India-China bilateral ties, where the 2020 military standoff continues, and theres a new furore over China’s map, which we spoke about last week. Brazilian President Lula is coming despite a hip injury- an important visit, as he last came as President more than a decade ago, and then came in 2012 to receive the Indira Gandhi Peace Prize. Brazil is also the next host of the G20 4. Then there are the non-aligned countries like Turkey, whose President Erdogan, fresh from his electoral victory, will be here- along with UN Secretary General they are trying to revive the Black Sea Grain initiative to allow the flow of wheat and sunflower exports from Ukraine and Russia. There’s also Argentina’s Fernandez, and Indonesian President Widodo, who last year as G20 President visited both Moscow and Kyiv. Mexican President Obrador will not attend. 5. A special guest is Saudi Arabian Crown Prince and PM Mohammad Bin Salman, who will stay on for a State visit on Monday. Remember MbS, as he is known was due to visit India before the Bali G20 and cancelled at the last hour. He will want to discuss infrastructure and road and railway development in his region- part of the new Quad with US, UAE and India. 6. There are the special invitees: Spain, Singapore, Netherlands and UAE are major economies and invited nearly every year. Spanish President Sanchez however has cancelled as he tested positive for Covid India has invited neighbours Bangladesh and Mauritius- PM Hasina has a special mission this year, as she is backing her daughter for the top regional post of the World Health Organisation, and will be canvassing support. Also here will be the WHO chief Ghebreyseus. Egypt, Nigeria and Oman have also been invited. Finally, there is the African Union, and its President Azali Assoumani who will be here for the big decision- as the AU awaits a final decision at the summit for membership of the G20 that it has been pursuing. This year PM Modi took it up with a letter to all G20 leaders, and the membership has the backing of the whole G20 grouping. So what are the key takeaways India is hoping for at the end of this summit- 1. Joint Declaration- Every G20 thus far has had a joint statement, and Indian negotiators are trying hard to ensure this is not the first G20 to end without a Leaders Declaration. -The main sticking point is over two paragraphs called the Bali paragraphs, that relate to Ukraine, but Russia doesn’t want the language criticizing its invasion of Ukraine, and China doesn’t want any geopolitical issues. - Apart from Ukraine there is a divide between the G7 and the developing world over Climate Change deadlines, financing and phasing out fossil fuels - And China is opposing language from G7, India and others on debt restructuring for vulnerable countries - Unlike Indonesia and President Jokowi, PM Modi has chosen not to travel to either Kyiv or Moscow ahead of summit, and has not invited Pres Zelensky to address the G20. 2. African Union- This will be a defining moment for the G20, which has not inducted new members in its history of nearly 25yrs. Like the EU, questions have been raised why the AU has not been included. Where is the pushback from? Other region groupings like ASEAN and CELAC who also want membership Countries like Switzerland, Singapore, Netherlands etc who are in the world’s top 20 today and feel they deserve a place in the membership Countries that worry inducting the 55-member AU might make consensus more difficult Even so , AU membership is likely to go through 3. Global South- India hosted the first Voice of Global South to take into account the developing world’s priorities on economic issues 4. Climate change , Health, Digital Public Infrastructure, Biofuel alliance and regulating Cryptocurrency- areas where India wants to make a mark – There is some pushback from China on Indian language insertions- like Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, Millets, Lifestyle for Environment 5. Democratisation of G20 process- the government has called this the People’s G20, because it has taken what used to be a fairly staid conference and given it colour and diverse flavours- holding 200 meetings in about 60 cities across the country 6. Black Sea Grain Initiative- this would be an outcome on the sidelines- if UN Secretary General Guterres,Turkish President Erdogan are able to convince Russia and G-7 to revive the initiative- basically allowing Russia more access to the financial system, so it lifts the blockade on Ukrainian ships carrying grain. Russia and Ukraine combined account for 21% of global grain trade. 7. Finally, there is the G20 venue itself, that the government wants to showcase- with the construction of the 3,000 crore rupee- Bharat Mandapam- which will house all the meetings and the main banquet. Construction delays have been an issue, and while India originally began making the venue in 2017, and was due to hold the G20 in 2021, it swapped twice with Italy and Indonesia, to hold it this year- many pointing out the political timing just ahead of the next elections. WV Take While the G20 is held in some member country each year by rotation, India has faced many special odds in its presidency- From the economic crisis and the covid pandemic, the continuing Ukraine war with more entrenched positions from Russia and China, and India’s bilateral issues with China at the LAC. It has countered much of this by original thought, and bringing back some of its older policies on the importance of the Global South to make its presidency unique. However, it is the need to build consensus amongst the Global economic elite at the G20 – and forge a Leaders declaration that will really test the mettle of the government the most, and where New Delhi could truly make its mark.

"There will be no gold for the USA at the Basketball World Cup, after 113-111 loss to Germany","There will be no gold medal for the U.S. at this World Cup. And for the second consecutive time in FIBA’s biggest tournament, there might not be any medal at all for the Americans. Instead, it’s Germany on the cusp of a world title. Andreas Obst scored 24 points, Franz Wagner added 22 and Germany shredded the U.S. defense for much of the way in its first win over the Americans — 113-111 in the World Cup semifinals on Friday night. Obst hit the shot of the night, a 3-pointer with 1:15 left to put Germany up by four and just about snuff out a last-ditch U.S. rally. Germany led for 30 of the game’s 40 minutes, the U.S. led for about 4 1/2, and there was little question who was controlling play much of the way. “We knew the task at hand, and that was to go win,” U.S. guard Austin Reaves said. “And we didn’t do that.” The U.S., down by 10 midway through the fourth, nearly pulled off a comeback, getting within one point on two separate occasions in the final minutes. But the Americans never got the lead, and it was the Germans jumping and hugging as time expired. Germany — the last unbeaten team left in the tournament at 7-0 — will play Serbia on Sunday (8:40 a.m. EDT) for the World Cup title. Serbia beat Canada in the first semifinal, getting to its second World Cup final in the last three tournaments; it lost 129-92 to the U.S. in the 2014 championship game. Advertisement Canada will play the U.S. for bronze Sunday (4:40 a.m. EDT). Anthony Edwards scored 23 points for the U.S. (5-2), which got 21 from Reaves, 17 from Mikal Bridges and 15 from Jalen Brunson. The Americans shot 58% — but let Germany shoot 58% as well, and that was the ultimate undoing. “If you give up 113 points in a 40-minute game, you’re not going to win many of those,” Reaves said. Advertisement Germany had been 0-6 against the Americans in World Cup or Olympic competition, usually getting blown out in those games. Not this time. Once again, even bringing the only roster filled with all NBA players wasn’t enough for the U.S. at the World Cup. The Americans finished seventh at the 2019 World Cup in China; this finish — third or fourth — will technically be better, but nothing other than gold was going to be satisfactory for USA Basketball.

Shubhankar Sharma maintains momentum to stay in lead at Irish Open,"India's Shubhankar Sharma was unstoppable for the first nine as he raced through the front nine in 7-under 28 with seven birdies and two pars to stay in the lead in the second round of the Irish Open golf at Kildare (Ireland) on Friday. Shubhankar Sharma(Getty Images) After 27 holes, Sharma was bogey-free and 14 under with 12 birdies and one eagle at the K Club. A bogey each on the Par-5 tenth and the Par-4 17th where he went into the water pushed him back as he had two bogeys and a birdie on 11th for a day's work of 6-under after the first round 7-under. At 13-under he was sox shots ahead of the next player at one stage. Later in the afternoon, Jordan Smith, who shot 6-under 66 in the first round was 7-under through 12 holes to get to 13-under and join Sharma. Smith still had six holes to play. ""I was a really quick start. A bit early in the morning for us. I was a little sleepy, too,"" said Sharma. ""I had nine single putts. I don't think I have done that before. It was amazing. It was flowing nicely. I was hitting in the right spots and I was really good inside 10 feet. ""It was still hot, unusual for Ireland. The greens were better. It is still gettable and scoreable"" He added. ""I am not much of a stats guy. Good you told me. I am a bit of a feel guy. I was sick last week but played good this week. I have been working on some things and it's good to see things working out."" After finishing late on the first day, Sharma was among the early starters on the second day, and he was quick off the blocks. Birdies on first and second were followed by two more on fourth and fifth. The run continued with three in a row from seventh to ninth. At the turn he was seven under with seven birdies and two bogeys in 7-under 28. He needed just nine putts for the front nine and all were single putts. On the back nine, the run stopped with two bogeys and just one birdie. Freddy Schott of Germany who had a 71 on first day added 64 on the second to get to nine-under and with him was Ross Fisher, who shot 66 on the first day and was 3-under through eight holes in the second. On the first day Sharma compiled his best round of 2023 as he put together a bogey free 7-under 65 that included an eagle and five birdies to sit at the top. Sharma, who had a super Top-10 finish at the Open in July, has had just one other Top-10 this season, which was T-7 at the first event of 2023 in Abu Dhabi. Ranked 65th on the Race to Dubai, and needing to be inside Top-50 to make the season-ending DP World Tour Championships in November in Dubai, Sharma started from the tenth tee late in the afternoon on the Palmer North Course. It was not a great day for the other Indian in the field, Manu Gandas, who shot 1-over 73 and was lying T-104th, needing a very low round to make the cut. Sharma was the first Indian recipient of the Sir Henry Cotton Rookie of the Year Trophy on DP World Tour in 2018. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics Shubhankar Sharma",sports
Sabalenka's astonishing comeback sets up final against Gauff,"A three-set defeat after serving an opening-set bagel can be a sour outcome to digest, as Madison Keys would’ve felt after losing her US Open semi-final to Aryna Sabalenka with an astonishing 6-0, 6-7(1), 6-7(5-10) scoreline on Thursday night. Aryna Sabalenka, of Belarus, returns a shot to Madison Keys, of the United States, during the women's singles semifinals of the U.S. Open(AP) Sabalenka would know, having been through the rare reversal herself in February at a WTA event in Dubai. Turning up for her first tournament since becoming a Grand Slam champion at the Australian Open, Sabalenka imploded in a 6-0, 6-7(2), 1-6 quarter-final loss to Barbora Krejcikova. The big-hitting Belarusian has been prone to such mid-match breakdowns, and showed signs of that on Thursday as Keys unlocked her beast mode for the first six games. Getting broken again in the third game of the second set, Sabalenka went chattering away to her box, slammed her racquet against the towel stand and flung it towards her team. The meltdown done; it was immediately dusted. In the next game and on her third break point where Keys struck a backhand wide, Sabalenka stared at her box again, this time with an assured first bump. That would be the start of the top-drawer turnaround from the world No. 1-in-waiting that put Sabalenka one step away from her career and season’s second Slam triumph, although home favourite Coco Gauff would like one of her own on Saturday. The Australian Open champion has been a familiar face in the semi-finals of all majors this year— the first woman to do so in a single season since Serena Williams in 2016. This was, however, only her second win from seven outings in the last-four stage of Slams. All the other five defeats came in three-setters, with Sabalenka blowing an opening-set lead in three of them. ""I (kept) reminding myself that I lost a lot of tough matches. One day all those matches should just, like, help me somehow,"" Sabalenka said after the semi-final. Those matches were also ill-timed. In each of her three Slam appearances last year — she was banned from competing at Wimbledon — Sabalenka lost after winning the first set. The 25-year-old's three-set hoodoo carried forward into this season, and even after her Australian ascendancy. First set won yet semi-final lost against Ons Jabeur at Wimbledon. Second set won yet semi-final lost against Karolina Muchova at Roland Garros. However, that Australian Open final with Elena Rybakina in which Sabalenka dropped the first set yet picked up the trophy on her fourth championship point did teach her that when the going is tough, ""take a deep breath and just work"". Which she did in her semi-final at Flushing Meadows when Sabalenka was rattled for much for the first two sets but not routed, mentally or otherwise. Down 0-6, 4-5 with Keys serving for the match, Sabalenka broke to love. Down a break again in the third set at 2-4, Sabalenka broke right back and then thwarted two more break chances to take the late-night tussle to a 10-point dash in which she cruised. ""This kind of thinking helped me to stay in the game and give me some hope that I'll be able to turn around this match, that the match is not over until the last point, and that I just have to keep fighting, keep trying to find my rhythm, my game, just find myself,"" she said. If Sabalenka does find her game in the final, the teenaged Gauff will have a tall task. The American also overcame some tricky moments in her 6-4, 7-5 semi-final win against the wily Muchova, and has been on song in the US hard-court swing. In her previous Slam final show, though, a clearly overawed Gauff managed to win just four games in Paris last year. Sabalenka, from her first major final, is bound to be richer by the down-but-not-out experience in Melbourne this year.

Irish fans mock France with Lionel Messi’s Argentina jersey in Euro qualifiers,"The France football team are still dealing with the memories of last year’s FIFA World Cup final, where a gritty Argentina, led by Lionel Messi, earned a thrilling victory to claim the coveted piece of silverware. Thanks to some Irish football fans and their playful antics, the French team were reminded of that painful defeat once again. France took on the Republic of Ireland in the 2024 Euro qualifying campaign in Paris on September 8. The Irish supporters did not get a chance to celebrate a goal during the one-sided game but they made sure to pull the legs of the home fans present at the Parc des Princes. Ireland fans with Messi's jersey While the match was going on, some Irish fans were spotted holding up Argentina shirts, bearing the name of Messi, in a bid to mock the French players. The event was caught on camera and the pictures of it have gone viral on social media. The rivalry between Argentina and France has been intriguing in recent times. The two sides were involved in a thrilling knockout encounter in the 2018 World Cup and France had emerged victorious in that contest by a margin of four goals to three. The French football team eventually went on to lift the World Cup trophy five years back. France once again faced Argentina in the final of the Qatar World Cup at the Lusail Stadium in Doha in December 2023. La Albiceleste got the last laugh in that meeting. Messi was at his best and scored the opening goal for Argentina before Angel Di Maria made it 2-0 in the 36th minute. Late in the game, Kylian Mbappe came up with two back-to-back goals to force the summit clash head into extra-time. Messi once again found the back of the net in the 108th minute to earn a lead for his side. But the lead was cancelled out after Mbappe converted a penalty. Mbappe’s late equaliser was enough to take the final contest to a penalty shootout. Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez lit up the show during the tie-breaker and made two consecutive saves to seal the deal. Coming back to EURO qualifiers, France got the better of Ireland by two goals to nil. In the 19th minute, midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni broke the deadlock. Marcus Thuram doubled the lead for the hosts in the 48th minute. With this victory on home soil, France are expected to maintain their unbeaten streak in the Euro qualifiers.

"Ahead of Sept US Fed meeting, policymakers sit tight on rates, debate if more needed","Ahead of their policy-setting meeting this month, Federal Reserve policymakers have been pretty clear about two things: They are not itching to raise interest rates, but few among them are ready to declare victory, either. The U.S. central bank has lifted its policy rate by 5.25 percentage points over the last 18 months, raising the cost of borrowing for households and businesses to temper demand and cool what had been 40-year high inflation. Those higher rates have begun to bite: Job growth has slowed, and inflation in the last couple of months has come down sharply, hitting 3.3% by the Fed's preferred measure in July, down from 7% last summer. And for now, even the Fed's more hawkish policymakers are content to let the data play out, even as they monitor whether surprisingly strong consumer spending and a still-tight labor market could feed inflationary pressures. ""Another skip could be appropriate when we meet later this month,"" Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said late on Thursday. ""My base case, though, is that there is work left to do."" Logan was among the last of Fed policymakers to speak before they begin a week and a half of public silence in the lead-up to their Sept. 19-20 policy-setting meeting. And while fellow policymakers hold a range of views, none have pushed back strongly against broad financial market expectations the Fed will leave its policy rate in the current target range of 5.25%-5.5% at that meeting. ""We can just sit"" and wait to see if inflation continues to trend downward, the usually hawkish Fed Governor Chris Waller said earlier this week. DATA AND FORECASTS Fresh Fed forecasts to be published at the close of this month's meeting will show how policymakers as a group expect inflation and unemployment to behave, and whether they like Logan think further tightening is likely to be needed. In June, the last time the Fed published economic projections, two-thirds of Fed policymakers indicated they thought rates would need to rise to above 5.5% by year's end in order to bring inflation down sustainably to the Fed's 2% goal. ""It's still an open question as we go forward: Have we got sufficiently restrictive to achieve that,"" New York Fed President John Williams said on Thursday. Williams, like others, said he's watching the data closely to guide policy. Chief among data to be released before the upcoming meeting is a read on the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index next Wednesday, which is expected to show inflation by this measure having ticked up to 3.6% last month due largely to higher gas prices. Underlying price pressures, however, likely continued to cool, according to a Reuters poll of economists. Other data expected next week include retail sales and the Producer Price Index, neither of which are expected to challenge progress towards what Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee calls the ""golden path"" of slowing inflation without a recession. Still, rate-setters are on the lookout for potholes, including a potential autoworkers strike that could, Goolsbee says, have a material impact on policy. On the other side of the ledger, unexpectedly strong data in coming weeks and months could firm up the case for another rate hike before the end of the year. Financial markets are currently pricing in about a 40% chance of that.",business
RBI okays interim Kotak chief for 2 months,"Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has approved the appointment of Dipak Gupta as interim managing director and chief executive officer of Kotak Mahindra Bank for a period of two months instead of four, indicating its intent to appoint a full-time chief during this period. The appointment of Gupta was necessitated by the sudden resignation of founder Uday Kotak effective 1 September. The RBI, through its letter dated 7 September 2023, approved Gupta’s appointment for a period of two months with effect from 2 September, Kotak Mahindra Bank said in a stock exchange filing. Kotak’s resignation came four months ahead of the end of his tenure on 31 December. As an interim arrangement, Gupta, the bank’s joint managing director, was nominated to carry out the duties of the MD and CEO till 31 December. Following his resignation, Kotak, whose shareholding in the bank stands at 26%, has been inducted into the board as a non-executive independent director. As the regulations allow large shareholders a maximum term of 15 years as CEO or wholetime director, the bank’s board has decided to induct Kotak as a non-executive director for five years. While the regulations are silent on promoter CEOs continuing as non-executive directors, concerns remain over whether Kotak could wield influence over the board. Kotak Mahindra Bank is currently awaiting RBI approval on the proposed CEO succession. The bank had engaged an executive search firm for finding the successor. KVS Manian and Shanti Ekambaram are among the internal candidates in the running. In his resignation letter, Kotak had mentioned that his exit has been timed in such a manner that it does not overlap with the stepping down of the chairman and Gupta by the end of December. “It was a voluntary decision taken by me to step down. If you go back, we were all in transition. Transition meant three people stepping down at the same time. This is just sequencing out,"" he told on 3 September. Kotak said his fiduciary responsibilities for transition and sequencing are done and he didn’t want to continue till the last day. “I spent 38 years. A few months here or there doesn’t matter. There is this whole overhang in the market over the transition. So, I have taken the first step towards that. There is an interim CEO, subject to regulatory approval,"" he said in the interview.",business

May it rain harder on second day and these malicious plans not succeed: Venkatesh Prasad blasts ACC for adding reserve day only for IND-PAK,"Even though there was no game scheduled at the 2023 Asia Cup on Friday, the tournament was still very much the buzz of the cricket town. With the Asian Cricket Council adding a reserve day for the India-Pakistan Super 4 game and the final, and for none of the other remaining games which’ll also feature Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, the decision was met with widespread criticism. With the Sri Lanka-Bangladesh game scheduled for Saturday also under rain threat, the two sets of coaches would lend their thoughts on the subject. “Little surprised when I first heard,” Sri Lanka coach Chris Silverwood said about ACC’s decision to have different playing conditions. A reserve day for India Pakistan contest in Super 11 Asia Cup Super 4 stage has been added that effectively revised the Asia Cup playing condition. To clarify on the position, the decision was taken with the consent of all four participating teams and ACC. — Bangladesh Cricket (@BCBtigers) September 8, 2023 His counterpart Chandika Hathurusingha would echo the sentiment, “It is not ideal, and we also would have liked to have an extra day.” Even though, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) would later state that the decision “was taken with the consent of all four participating teams and ACC.” READ | Asia Cup: Sri Lanka, Bangladesh coaches cry foul over extra day for India-Pakistan game Former India pacer Venkatesh Prasad would also give his opinion via his social media, bashing the organizers for their decision.

"Georgia special grand jury recommended charges against 39 people, including Senator Lindsey Graham","The special grand jury that investigated efforts by Donald Trump and others to overturn Georgia’s 2020 election results recommended indictments against twice as many people as the 19 ultimately charged by prosecutors, leaving South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham among those not indicted. The grand jurors' report released Friday showed they recommended charges against 39 people, including Graham, former U.S. Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue of Georgia and former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn. Released at the request of the special grand jury, the report provides insight into one of the most expansive investigations into Mr. Trump, who is also facing two federal indictments along with unrelated state charges in New York City. While critics have accused Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis of launching an unwieldy, overly broad case, the report suggests she used her discretion to streamline the case. There are many reasons Willis might have chosen not to charge all those recommended, including immunity deals with some, federal protections for others or insufficient evidence to prove charges beyond a reasonable doubt. The special grand jury included Mr. Graham’s name in a section about “the national effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election,” which Mr. Trump, the incumbent Republican, lost to Democrat Joe Biden. The South Carolina senator, who was chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time, called Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger shortly after the November election, and Mr. Raffensperger has said Mr. Graham asked him whether he had the power to reject certain absentee ballots. Mr. Perdue and Mr. Loeffler were sitting U.S. senators who had failed to win enough votes in the November 2020 general election and were forced into a January 2021 runoff, which they both ultimately lost to Democratic challengers. In the weeks after the election, they were vocal in their criticism of Mr. Raffensperger, going so far as to call for his resignation. In an interview on a right-wing cable news channel in mid-December 2020, Mr. Flynn said Mr. Trump “could take military capabilities” and place them in swing states and “basically rerun an election in each of those states.” He also traveled to the South Carolina home of conservative lawyer Lin Wood in November 2020, where Mr. Wood has said meetings were held to discuss possible ways to influence the election results in Georgia and elsewhere. The special grand jury also recommended charges for Wood. Mr. Trump, the early front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, blasted the report on his Truth Social site, saying, “They wanted to indict anybody who happened to be breathing at the time.” Mr. Graham, who has denied any wrongdoing, said, “It should never be a crime for a federal elected official, particularly the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who will have to vote to certify a presidential election, to question and ensure the integrity of that election.” Mr. Loeffler, who has stayed involved in politics by founding and funding a Republican-aligned group called Greater Georgia, said she was speaking up for people who felt disenfranchised in the 2020 election. “Trying to jail your party’s leading political opponent ahead of 2024 is election interference. Speaking out in defense of election integrity is not,"" she said on social media website X (formerly Twitter). Mr. Flynn pointed to his lawyer Jesse Binnall's post on X: “General Michael Flynn will continue to fight for the truth, for America First principles, and for Donald Trump’s return to The White House in 2024.” Mr. Wood, who spoke before the special grand jury after receiving a subpoena, said he did nothing wrong: “It seems unfair to me that I get smeared as someone that is recommended for indictment when the people with the power to look at the evidence and indict did not indict me.” Representatives for Mr. Perdue didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The special grand jury foreperson, Emily Kohrs, spoke of her experience in an interview with The Associated Press in February that was followed by interviews in other print and television news outlets. She said the panel recommended multiple people be indicted but declined to name names, citing a judge's decision not to release the full report at that time. While Mr. Kohrs' whirlwind media tour was attacked by Mr. Trump's lawyers at the time and raised fears among some Mr. Trump critics that it could jeopardize the investigation, the judge overseeing the special grand jury made clear that grand jurors are free to talk about anything but their deliberations. The panel spent seven months hearing from some 75 witnesses before completing a report in December with recommendations for Mr. Willis on charges. The release of the identities of people recommended for indictment is a departure from ordinary grand jury protocol, which dictates that prosecutors do not disclose the names of individuals investigated but not charged so as to prevent potentially innocent subjects from being unduly maligned. Special grand juries in Georgia are relatively uncommon and are essentially an investigative tool. They can subpoena witnesses and evidence but do not have the power to bring an indictment. Instead, they can produce a report with recommendations that are not binding on a district attorney, who can then seek an indictment from a regular grand jury. The special grand jury's report is based on the testimony of the witnesses prosecutors called and the evidence they presented over about seven months last year. In their report, the grand jurors made clear that the panel “contained no election law experts or criminal lawyers.” Of the 19 people ultimately indicted, only one was not included in the special grand jury's recommendations. A former White House aide who served as the director of Trump’s Election Day operations, Michael Roman, was involved in efforts to put forth a set of fake electors after the 2020 election. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ordered the partial release of the report in February but declined to immediately release the panel’s recommendations on who should or should not be prosecuted. The judge said at the time that he wanted to protect people’s due process rights. Mr. McBurney said in a new order filed Aug. 28 that the due process concerns were moot since a regular grand jury had indicted Trump and 18 other people under the state's anti-racketeering law. All have pleaded not guilty. Many of those indicted — including former New York Mayor and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani and Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows — are known to have testified before the special grand jury. Mr. Trump was never called. The parts of the report previously released in February included its conclusions, as well as a section with the grand jurors expressing concerns that one or more witnesses may have lied under oath and urging prosecutors to seek charges for perjury.",world
Ukraine war unlikely to end in immediate future: UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres,"Efforts to build a peaceful world are faltering and the Ukraine conflict is unlikely to end in the immediate future, said Secretary General of the United Nations Antonio Guterres here on Friday. Speaking at a press conference ahead of the G-20 summit that will begin here on Saturday, Mr. Guterres laid out the concerns of the UN and said the world cannot “go on like this” and spoke forcefully seeking change of the global multilateral institutions. He also appreciated India for placing the “development agenda at the centre” of G-20. “Divisions are growing, tensions are flaring up, and trust is eroding — which together raise the spectre of fragmentation and ultimately confrontation. The global financial architecture is outdated, dysfunctional, and unfair. It requires deep, structural reform. And the same can be said about the United Nations Security Council,” said Mr. Guterres. He appreciated India’s G-20 Presidency. “India has assumed the G-20 Presidency with a very strong priority on the development agenda and at the same time, India has been doing everything possible to fully represent the interest of the Global South in the preparation of the summit. India has indeed corresponded to its promise not only to speak on behalf of the Global South but to put the development agenda at the centre of the G-20 works,” said Mr. Guterres. He said the conflict in Ukraine was likely to drag on as both the sides — Ukraine and Russia — have “decided to move on with the conflict.” “I am not very hopeful of a peace solution in the immediate future. Obviously we should pay tribute to those who tried to do everything possible to find this dramatic situation find an end,” said the Secretary General. His comments are being viewed as a push to have consensus on pressing issues at the G-20 summit that is beginning on September 9 here. The Ukraine crisis has created a divide between the Western bloc and the rest in G-20 including the Indian Presidency that has insisted on keeping the platform focused on the issues before the Global South. “We need effective international institutions rooted in 21st century realities and based on the UN Charter and international law,” said Mr. Guterres. He expressed concern about the increase in conflicts across the world and urged concerted actions to address climate change — “Wars and conflicts are multiplying — but efforts to advance peace are faltering.” “I have come to the G-20 with a simple but urgent appeal: we cannot go on like this. We must come together and act together for the common good. Challenges stretch as far as the eye can see,” said Mr. Guterres, urging the G-20 leaders to show leadership in dealing with the climate crisis.",world
Hungary vs Czechia Prediction and Betting Tips | September 10th 2023,"Hungary will entertain Czechia at the Puskás Aréna Park in an international friendly on Sunday.

“Don’t play with my emotions King James”: LeBron James’ cheeky reaction to Team USA Dream team at Paris Olympics 2024 has fans buzzing,"LeBron James sent NBA fans into a frenzy with his cryptic response to a photoshopped Team USA Olympics roster, including him and several other superstars. The post went viral in the wake of the country's 2023 FIBA World Cup exit at the hands of Germany. USA deployed a young roster with no prior international experience. As many doubters expected, the team faltered against a worthy opponent in a knockout game. Several critics have called for the USA to recruit top-tier superstars starting with the 2023 Paris Olympics, including James, Steph Curry and Kevin Durant. The last time so many alphas were on the same team was in 2012 during the London Olympics when LeBron James played alongside the late Kobe Bryant, Chris Paul , Kevin Durant and Carmelo Anthony. The Americans went undefeated in the tournament and won the gold. Here's the viral post that James' reacted toL It's an enticing prospect to see LeBron team up with Steph Curry and Kevin Durant to play meaningful basketball again. It would be a rendition of the 1992 Dream Team or 2008 Redeem Team. These legends have only a few years left at the top level, so this could be their shot to produce a one-of-one moment. James' comment using the eyes emoji has NBA 'X' formerly known as Twitter, hyped. One fan wrote: More reactions followed: Team USA selecting young players didn't seem like they were taking a casual approach. That instead seemed like a trend they wanted to follow with this group and nurture these players to immerse more continuity and cohesiveness for future tournaments. It's easier to do that with a group of young players as they can stick around longer than veteran stars, who have avoided being part of international tournaments in the offseason. LeBron James has passed the opportunity to play in four separate international tournaments in a row, so the USA could continue with their current selection process and make marginal upgrades instead. Former USA basketball Managing Director Jerry Colangelo also reflected on James' decision to pass on being part of Team USA over the last few years in 2021, saying that his time is likely over in the international scene. LeBron James may be flirting with the idea of playing for Team USA one last time. But for now, it seems like a far-fetched prospect, considering he will be playing his 21st NBA season next year and will likely take the offseason to recover, especially if he intends to return for a 22nd season.

Which basketball player is widely credited with inspiring NCAA to temporarily ban slam dunks?,"It's rare for the NCAA to make a rule change for just one player, but that happened back in the 1960s. They decided to ban the slam dunk soley because of one player. That player was NBA Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Before emerging as a star for the Milwaukee Bucks and LA Lakers, Lew Alcindor was an unstoppable force in the NCAA while playing for UCLA. Standing at 7-foot-2, Kareem was able to dunk over his opponents with ease. This led to a leaguewide ban of the slam dunk in college basketball. While the NCAA never came right out and said it, this rule was put in place because of Kareem. Sportswriters at the time even dubbed it the Lew Alcindor rule. The ban ended up lasting for 10 seasons starting in 1967. Because of this ban, one of basketball's most unstoppable moves was formed. Since he was not allowed to dunk in games anymore, Kareem began working on his skyhook. This ended up being his go-to move in the NBA as defenders were unable to reach his outstretched arm. Even though he wasn't able to dunk, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was still one of the most dominant players in NCAA history. Along with putting up big numbers, he won a national championship in each of his three seasons at UCLA. In terms of scoring, Kareem had his best season as a freshman. His first college season ended with him averaging 29.0 points and 15.5 rebounds across 30 games. The future Hall of Fame center followed that up with averages of 26.2 points and 16.5 rebounds as a sophomore. Kareem finished off his college career as a junior, where he posted 24.0 points and 14.7 rebounds in 30 games. Along with his three championships Kareem also won the Naismith Award and was a two-time AP Player of the Year. Following his junior season, Kareem entered his name in the 1969 NBA Draft. He was selected first overall by the Milwaukee Bucks. The seven-foot phenom ended up playing the NBA for two decades, mainly as a member of the LA Lakers . Kareem racked up a long list of accolades that has cemented him as one of the five greatest players to ever play the game. If there was any doubt to just how great Kareem was, the ban college basketball put on him is a prime example. Why Does The NBA Hate The Next Usain Bolt?! And Who Is He??! Quick Links",sports
Jagex responds to the Runescape community's huge backlash to Hero Pass,"The Hero Pass is an extremely controversial Battle Pass-like feature introduced by Jagex in Runescape (RS3, not OSRS) that led to a huge backlash. Many players saw the addition of such a system as more P2W microtransactions in a game already littered with microtransactions. Naturally, this led to people voicing their concerns and review bombing RS3 on Steam and other platforms. Jagex finally delivered a detailed response to the divisive Hero Pass on September 8, 2023. The UK company admitted that several parts of this new Runescape feature were a mistake and plans to remove the more controversial aspects in a recent blog post detailed below. Jagex released a blog post called ""Hero Pass - Player Feedback Update #2,"" which was addressed to the whole Runescape community . It starts off with: Many RS3 players hated the nerfs to Daily Challenges, a Premier Pass having Hero Pass XP buffs, and the ability to purchase Hero Pass levels. Unsurprisingly, Jagex addressed these issues: These are some significant changes. Note that Jagex has no plans to remove Hero Pass as a whole. The company has long-term plans for this system in Runescape, which they are expected to announce in the future. Anybody who wants a refund can contact customer support if they're unhappy about the changes to the Premier Pass. Note: All these Reddit posts were made before the recent changes. They are merely posted here to give readers an idea of how much the Hero Pass was hated in its original state. It is no exaggeration to say that the Hero Pass's debut was one of the most scrutinized features in recent Runescape history. The community unequivocally despised it, especially on social media platforms. Some popular posts on Reddit can be seen above, which range from a former Jagex moderator being disappointed to people canceling their subscriptions. Some people envied how much better OSRS seemed to be faring as that community barely has microtransactions and is getting Sailing as a new skill. Given the immense vitriol toward Hero Pass, it should come across as no surprise that some Runescape players started review-bombing RS3. The above Reddit post shows a significant increase in negative reviews that was virtually unprecedented in the game's recent history. The above Reddit comments are examples of fans who are happy that Jagex finally decided to revert some controversial aspects of Hero Pass. Modern reception to the adjustments has been almost universally positive, although it has incited new discussions about microtransactions as a whole. The new popular topic for Runescape players to discuss is removing the game's abundance of microtransactions. This game is over-monetized when compared to OSRS (which only has bonds as MTX). Some players don't mind cosmetics, but any microtransactions tied to gameplay tend to be much less appreciated by the general community. It will be interesting to see if this new movement will affect how Jagex looks at microtransactions for Runescape 3 as a whole, as unlikely as it may seem.

Max Verstappen or Lewis Hamilton? Former F1 champion answers who he would be “more fearful going up against”,"Former Formula 1 champion Jenson Button has expressed that he would be ""more fearful"" going head-to-head with Max Verstappen than Lewis Hamilton. Button's insights come in response to recent comments made by Hamilton, who stated that all of his previous teammates have proven stronger than Verstappen throughout their respective F1 careers. Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button, who were teammates at McLaren from 2010 to 2012, enjoyed a closely contested rivalry, with Button outscoring his illustrious counterpart over the course of three seasons. While both Hamilton and Max Verstappen have demonstrated exceptional prowess behind the wheel, Button's perspective sheds light on the unique challenges posed by each driver's distinctive style. In an interview with Sky Sports News, Button remarked: Explaining the reasoning behind his assertion, Jenson Button elaborated: He continued: Button went on to emphasize Max Verstappen's adaptability and skill in mastering the intricacies of his racing machine. He said: In Button's estimation, the trio of Max Verstappen, Lewis Hamilton, and Fernando Alonso represent the pinnacle of Formula 1 talent. He expressed a longing for heightened competition among these luminaries at the forefront of the sport. Button added: In the current landscape of Formula 1, Button acknowledged the prominence of technology as a decisive factor in racing success. He commended Red Bull Racing for their exceptional performance, acknowledging their superior execution in the ongoing technological race. He continued: As the 2023 Formula 1 season continues to unfold, the Verstappen-Hamilton rivalry continues to be among the most gripping narratives among F1 fans. Quick Links",sports
Rajasthan Premier League 2023: How did the IPL Players fare in Qualifier 2?,"Jodhpur Sunrisers bagged a convincing seven-wicket victory over Udaipur Lakecity Warriors in the second qualifier of Rajasthan Premier League to bag a spot in the grand finale. Batting first, Udaipur Lakecity Warriors opener Kartik Sharma stood tall in the powerplay overs after losing his partner Aditya Garhwal for a golden duck. Middle-order batters Samarpit Joshi, Rahul Tomar and Shahbaz Khan also played crucial knocks in the middle and death overs, helping their side in putting a total of 162/6 in the stipulated 20 overs. Ravindra Khichar was the top bowler for Jodhpur as he picked three crucial wickets of Kartik Sharma, Rahul Tomar and Shahbaz Khan to keep the opposition on the back foot. In the chase, Jodhpur lost their opener Dev Yadav for a golden duck. However, Abhijeet Tomar stood tall, scoring 82 runs off 53 balls. Batting at no.4, keeper-batter Bharat Sharma played a pivotal role with an unbeaten half-century to take his side over the line with 1.5 overs to spare.

Leg-spinner Rahul Chahar bagged the big wicket of Arjit Gupta in the middle overs to turn the tide towards his team. In his four-over quota, Chahar ended on the expensive side, conceding 44 runs.

Julio Urías arrest update: Dodgers pitcher in hot water as police take hold of new evidence,"The investigation around the domestic violence allegation against Dodgers' pitcher Julio Urias takes another step in the light of new evidence being surfaced. After an alleged domestic violence report on September 3, ace pitcher Julio Urias of the Los Angeles Dodgers found himself in police custody. The incident took place at the BMO stadium, where several celebrities gathered to watch soccer giant Lionel Messi play. The reported incident happened late Sunday evening. Corroborating to the story, a few stadium workers claimed to have watched Julio push a woman into a fence after the match. He was later set free on a fifty thousand dollar bond. Following the incident, as per MLB's domestic violence policy , the league took action in the form of placing the pitcher on administrative leave through the investigation period. The LAPD issued a statement suggesting Julio was a culprit as physical altercations were clearly visible by the time cops reached the scene. The case takes a new turn as police confirm possession of the video evidence of the event. Now that reports have come in that the police have the evidence, it will most likely be the end of Urias as a pitcher in MLB. This is the second time that someone has made domestic violence allegations against him.

"""I am living my dream"" - Barcelona starlet Lamine Yamal reacts after scoring on debut for Spain against Georgia","Lamine Yamal has admitted that he's living his dream after the Barcelona wonderkid scored on his international debut for Spain on Friday (September 8). The 16-year-old stepped off the bench in the 44th minute of La Roja's 7-1 demolition of Georgia in an UEFA Euro 2024 qualifier to become the youngest player in his nation's history. He then became their youngest goalscorer when he netted his side's seventh goal of the evening in the 74th minute. Yamal has become one of not only Barcelona but Spanish football's most promising teenagers. Many are touting him as the biggest talent to come out of their La Masia academy since Lionel Messi. Yamal also became the Blaugrana's youngest debutant earlier this year and their youngest player this century. The Barca sensation has reacted to his record-breaking first goal for Spain. He says that he made the right decision in opting to represent La Roja over Morocco who he was eligible for through his father (via EuroFoot): Yamal's stock is growing seemingly every time he steps on the pitch as he continues to break records. He has dazzled at the start of his Barcelona career, bagging two assists in five games across competitions. Blaugrana boss Xavi has high hopes for the young Spanish wonderkid (via ESPN): Yamal's goal for Spain capped off a 7-1 romp for De la Fuente's side over Georgia in their Euro 2024 qualifier. Alvaro Morata grabbed a hat-trick while Dani Olmo and Nico Williams were also on target. Solomon Kvirkvelia scored an own goal while Giorgi Chakvetadze scored a consolation goal for Georgia. Spain manager De la Fuente has admitted that Lamine Yamal is even better seeing him play up close than watching on television. The Spanish coach was yet to be given the opportunity to select the Barcelona teenager before now. He said (via BarcaBlaugranes): Yamal is following in the footsteps of many Spanish legends who started their career in the national team at an early age. The likes of his Barca teammates Gavi and Ansu Fati (on loan at Brighton & Hove Albion) also made their debuts at a similar age (both 17). However, the Barcelona teenager has eclipsed them as the youngest player in Spain's history. He could look to make more history when La Roja face Cyprus on Tuesday (September 12). He may even be pushing for a starting berth in De la Fuente's team. Quick Links",sports

After McGregor claimed he’d knock ‘The Highlight’ out, Gaethje took to Twitter to demand the Irishman “sign the contract”. Following this, Gaethje’s manager Ali Abdelaziz also hit out at McGregor in an inflammatory interview with MMA Underground.

"""I cried every day. I didn’t understand the culture"": Mila Kunis on how her parents were instrumental in her success post immigration","Mila Kunis is currently one of the most renowned celebrities in Hollywood, but the famous actress had to go through much worse than most to make it here. However, a major reason for her success was her parents, Mark and Elvira Kunis. In a recent interview with People, Mila Kunis reflected on her immigrant past, adjusting to the United States, and how her parents continued to be a solid rock in the middle of it all. Originally immigrants from Ukraine, Mila was just seven years old when her family migrated to the US following the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. Her parents reportedly came to the States with almost no money in their pockets. Mila revealed: She also recalled how she blocked out her second grade because of her troubles adjusting to the new place . Kunis added: However, things only got better from there as Mila's parents enrolled her in acting school at the age of 9, and before too long, she made her mark on the world. Instagram Post While coming to the United States may be the best thing that happened to Mila Kunis, as a girl of seven, it was hard for her to understand. Thus, her supportive and understanding parents took the duty of getting the kid through this trauma by lying to her about the move and being there for her. Mila Kunis said: After coming to the States, Mila's parents also changed careers to support their two children, sacrificing their respective dreams in the process. However, they firmly believed in Mila Kunis' ability to act. They reportedly spent $890 on acting classes for her despite having only $900 in the bank . Instagram Post And the young girl did not disappoint, landing her first commercial at the age of 9. Soon, success followed Mila Kunis as she slowly became a household name. But her parents never took a dime of her money, as revealed by the actress in the interview with People. So, in 2017, Mila and her husband, Ashton Kutcher , pulled off a surprise home makeover for her parents’ L.A. condo for the online series My Houzz . Mila said: As of now, Mila Kunis continues to take pride in both her parents and what they have done for her. Why Does The NBA Hate The Next Usain Bolt?! And Who Is He??! Quick Links",sports
[Watch] Shubman Gill cuts cake on his 24th birthday with Indian teammates,"Team India opener Shubman Gill celebrated his 24th birthday on Friday (September 8) with his teammates in Colombo. He is currently in the capital city of Sri Lanka, preparing for the upcoming Asia Cup 2023 match against Pakistan. Due to incessant rains, the Shubman Gill and co have been practicing in the indoor nets. Indian left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav gave fans a glimpse of Shubman Gill's birthday celebrations in the team camp. He shared a picture and video of the same on this official X (formerly known as Twitter) handle. In it, Gill can be seen cutting the cake in the presence of other players. Kuldeep captioned the post: Gill has displayed mixed batting form in two matches of the Asia Cup so far. He failed miserably in the first match against a red-hot Pakistan pace trio - Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah, and Haris Rauf - and scored only 10 runs from 32 balls. The youngster then hit a stroke-filled 67 against Nepal on Tuesday. Former Indian all-rounder Irfan Pathan recently shed light on a certain technical deficiency, which according to him, has restricted Shubman Gill from scoring fluently in the recent past. He explained his stance by analyzing Gill's dismissal against Haris Rauf in the group match of the Asia Cup. During a recent discussion on Star Sports, Pathan said: He added: The high-octane contest between India and Pakistan will happen on Sunday (September 10) at the R.Premadasa Stadium, Colombo.

Pac-12 and commish George Kliavkoff face legal actions from Washington St. and Oregon St. over existential threat: Reports,"The drama surrounding the Pac-12 Conference does not rest, as there seems to be another issue piling up. Oregon State and Washington State, the two schools that have not announced their departure, are seeking an emergency temporary restraining order against the Pac-12 and Commissioner George Kliavkoff. The bylaws of the Conference of Champions reportedly indicate that the league's board of directors should comprise only the pair of schools. The filing of the legal action took place, and there seem to be a lot of issues. Below is a section of the legal document: In layman's terms, the two programs feel they should control the distribution of the remaining assets of the conference and not the members leaving in 2024. To put a dollar figure on it, the filing states the conference ended the 2022 fiscal year with $42.7 million in net assets, not including the equity from the Pac-12 Networks. They also would have bowl contracts and College Football Playoff payouts while including $50.2 million from the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament as well as the name brand of the conference. It will be interesting to see how this goes and if this alters the future of the Conference of Champions. Whether people want to admit it or not, there is some value to the Pac-12 brand. Even if it is used as a rebranding for whatever conference to keep the namesake alive, there is still power in the media rights with the right leadership. It has become clear that George Kliavkoff would be a hindrance to the programs. They have been unable to find a media rights deal, which is one of the biggest forms of incompetence seen in a Power Five conference. They could not find an agreement, and 10 of the 12 members left. Washington State and Oregon State could hire Oliver Luck as the new commissioner and keep the conference running. It will be interesting as more details emerge. Quick Links",sports
Godzilla roars his way onto Apple TV+ in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters teaser,"reader comments 10 with Apple TV+'s new original series, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters , picks up where 2014's Godzilla left off. Stream Monarch: Legacy of Monsters on Apple TV+ $6.99 subscription after free trial at Apple (Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through affiliate programs .) Major film franchises expanding into streaming television is officially a trend: Star Wars, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the DC Universe, and now Legendary Entertainment's MonsterVerse , which brought together Godzilla, King Kong, and various other monsters ( kaiju ) created by Toho Co., Ltd into the same fold. There have been four feature films thus far, with a fifth slated for a 2024 release, plus the animated series Skull Island , which debuted on Netflix earlier this year. And now we've got the first teaser for Apple TV+'s Monarch: Legacy of Monsters , which picks up where the 2014 film Godzilla left off. Set 15 years after a nuclear disaster in Japan, the 2014 Godzilla reimagined the classic monster's origins and featured the titular beast battling giant winged parasitic creatures called MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) that feed off nuclear energy and waste (and also warheads). San Francisco suffered quite a bit of major property damage as a result. That film also introduced us to Project Monarch, a secret organization established in the 1950s to study Godzilla and other kaiju —after attempts to kill Godzilla with nuclear weapons failed. Monarch: Legacy of Monsters will further explore the history and aftermath of those events. Per the official premise: Following the thunderous battle between Godzilla and the Titans that leveled San Francisco, and the shocking revelation that monsters are real, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters tracks two siblings following in their father’s footsteps to uncover their family’s connection to the secretive organization known as Monarch. Clues lead them into the world of monsters and ultimately down the rabbit hole to Army officer Lee Shaw, taking place in the 1950s and half a century later where Monarch is threatened by what Shaw knows. The dramatic saga—spanning three generations—reveals buried secrets and the ways that epic, earth-shattering events can reverberate through our lives. Kurt Russell stars as Lee Shaw in the present day, while his son Wyatt Russell (who played John Walker in Falcon and the Winter Soldier ) plays Shaw as a young man in the 1950s. The cast also includes Anna Sawai as Cate Randa, a former schoolteacher and ""G-Day"" survivor; Kiersey Clemons as a ""roguish"" American ex-pat named May; Ren Watabe as Kentaro, who is on a personal quest to learn more about his mysterious father; Joe Tippett as Tim, described as an ""office drone"" who longs to be a secret agent; and Elisa Lasowski as an expert operative named Duvall. John Goodman reprises his role as Monarch researcher Bill Randa from 2017's Kong: Skull Island , with Anders Holm playing the younger version. Advertisement Enlarge / Kurt Russell stars as Army officer Lee Shaw. Apple TV+ The teaser doesn't tell us much more about the plot, but it does establish the major players. It opens with a voiceover by Bill Randa (speaking via an archival video). ""I can't go back in time and fix all the mistakes I made,"" he says. ""But maybe I can leave something for the future. A legacy."" Cut to the aging Shaw, declaring that ""the world is on fire"" and he is determined to do something about it. It seems Monarch has strayed from its original mission to protect both the Titans' world and our own; now, the project seems to just want to chase monsters. And it looks like we'll be getting monsters aplenty, along with the usual massive property damage. The teaser's worth it just for that great final shot of a roaring Godzilla himself. Monarch: Legacy of Monsters debuts on Apple TV+ on November 17, 2023. Listing image by Apple TV+",technology
X sues Calif. to avoid revealing how it makes “controversial” content decisions,"Enlarge Bloomberg / Contributor | Bloomberg reader comments 64 with Today, Elon Musk's X Corp. sued to block California's content moderation law, AB 587. In its complaint, filed a US district court in California, X Corp. is seeking a preliminary and permanent injunction stopping California Attorney General Robert Bonta from enforcing the law. AB 587 passed in September 2022, requiring social media platforms to submit a ""terms of service report"" semi-annually to California's attorney general, providing ""a detailed description of content moderation practices used"" and ""information about whether, and if so how, the social media company defines and moderates"" hate speech or racism, extremism or radicalization, disinformation or misinformation, harassment, and foreign political interference. Under the law, social media platforms must also provide information and statistics on any content moderation actions taken in those categories. In X's complaint, the company accused California of trying to dictate X's terms of service and compel ""controversial disclosures about how X Corp. moderates content on its platform."" The law stipulated that all platforms were required to start collecting data for their first terms of service report covering content moderation during the third quarter of 2023 and submit those reports to Bonta by January 1, 2024. Platforms could be found violating the law for failing to post terms of service about content moderation, missing a deadline to submit a terms of service report, or materially omitting or misrepresenting information about content moderation. Any platform violating the law risks fines—which X described as ""draconian financial penalties""—up to $15,000 per violation per day. In its complaint, X Corp. argued that AB 587 violates the First Amendment by compelling ""companies like X Corp. to engage in speech against their will"" and ""impermissibly"" interfering ""with the constitutionally protected editorial judgments of companies."" X Corp. said that if the court did not block the law, California could pressure companies ""to remove, demonetize, or deprioritize constitutionally protected speech that the state deems undesirable or harmful."" ""The State of California touts AB 587 as a mere 'transparency measure' under which certain social media companies must make their content moderation policies and statistics publicly available,"" X's complaint said. But, X alleged, the state's ""true intent"" is ""to pressure social media platforms to 'eliminate' certain constitutionally protected content viewed by the state as problematic."" Advertisement X Corp. alleged that AB 587 violates other laws, including the Dormant Commerce Clause—""failing to restrict its extensive reporting requirements to information about Californians""—and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act—which grants platforms immunity from liability for “any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.” ""Because AB 587 imposes liability on such actions if they are taken without the required disclosures, AB 587 is preempted by the broad immunity afforded by Section 230,"" X's complaint said. Ars could not immediately reach X for comment. Bonta's office said: “While we have not yet been served with the complaint, we will review it and respond in court.” The author of AB 587, California assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, released a statement saying that the law ""is a pure transparency measure that simply requires companies to be upfront about if and how they are moderating content. It in no way requires any specific content moderation policies—which is why it passed with strong, bipartisan support. If Twitter has nothing to hide, then they should have no objection to this bill.” But tech groups and policy experts echoed X's concerns over AB 587. Adam Kovacevich, the CEO of the tech industry policy coalition Chamber of Progress, said that ""requiring companies to give their content moderation playbook to scammers and conspiracists is a bad idea."" “Even if you don't like anything about Elon Musk’s leadership of X, it’s clear that requiring tech platforms to publish a detailed blueprint of how to work around content moderators will have negative consequences for users online,"" Kovacevich said.

"FTC judge rules Intuit broke law, must stop advertising TurboTax as “free”","Enlarge Getty Images | Sasirin Pamai reader comments 45 with The Federal Trade Commission's chief administrative law judge ruled that Intuit violated US law with deceptive advertising and should be forced to stop promoting TurboTax as ""free"" unless all conditions imposed on the free offer are immediately and conspicuously displayed to consumers. The initial decision by Administrative Law Judge D. Michael Chappell was released today and is subject to an automatic review by the full commission. The FTC commissioners will likely rule against Intuit, which issued a statement indicating that it will take the matter to federal court. The order would be in effect for 20 years if it survives appeal. The response from Intuit noted that the administrative law judge is ""an employee of the FTC"" and ""ruled in favor of the FTC in the agency's own lawsuit."" The FTC filed an administrative complaint against Intuit in March 2022. ""Intuit will appeal this groundless and seemingly predetermined decision by the FTC to rule in its own favor and is confident that when the matter ultimately returns to a neutral body Intuit will prevail, as it has previously in this matter,"" the company said. Intuit also said it ""already adheres to most of the advertising practices in the FTC's erroneous decision. There is no monetary penalty, and Intuit expects no significant impact to its business."" Clearly and conspicuously According to Chappell's 242-page ruling, ""the evidence proves that Intuit engaged in deceptive advertising in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act."" Intuit ""advertised to consumers that they could file their taxes online for free using TurboTax, when in truth, for approximately two-thirds of taxpayers, the advertised claim was false,"" he wrote. Advertisement The order said Intuit ""must not represent that a good or service is 'Free'"" unless it actually offers the good or service for free to all consumers, or ""All the terms, conditions, and obligations upon which receipt and retention of the 'Free' good or service are contingent are set forth clearly and conspicuously at the outset of the offer so as to leave no reasonable probability that the terms of the offer might be misunderstood."" Moreover, if an Intuit good or service is not free for most US taxpayers, that fact must be ""disclosed clearly and conspicuously at the outset of any disclosures required"" by the order. The order defines ""clearly and conspicuously"" in some detail. ""In any communication that is solely visual or solely audible, the disclosure must be made through the same means through which the communication is presented,"" it says. ""In any communication made through both visual and audible means, such as a television advertisement, the disclosure must be presented simultaneously in both the visual and audible portions of the communication even if the representation requiring the disclosure is made in only one means."" The order then provides more specifics on how disclosures must be conveyed in various formats. For example, visual disclosures ""must stand out from any accompanying text or other visual elements so that it is easily noticed, read, and understood,"" and audible disclosures ""must be delivered in a volume, speed, and cadence sufficient for ordinary consumers to easily hear and understand it."" Similarly strict requirements apply to online advertisements, product labels, and face-to-face communications. The disclosures also ""must not be contradicted or mitigated by, or inconsistent with, anything else in the communication."" Advertisement Court denied FTC injunction request At the same time it filed the administrative complaint last year, the FTC also sued Intuit in US District Court for the Northern District of California. In the federal court, a judge denied the FTC's motion for a preliminary injunction in an April 2022 order that said the issue could remain on hold while the FTC's administrative process unfolds. The ruling said that ""Intuit had removed several of the most plausibly deceptive advertisements—that is, three videos that repeated the word 'free' a dozen or more times over 30 seconds before a very brief disclaimer."" ""However, if Intuit resumes its full advertising campaign... or the facts on the ground change significantly, the FTC may return to this Court to request relief,"" US District Judge Charles Breyer wrote. In a separate case involving all 50 US states and the District of Columbia, Intuit, in May 2022, agreed to pay $141 million in restitution to nearly 4.4 million consumers who ""started using TurboTax's Free Edition for tax years 2016 through 2018 and were told that they had to pay to file even though they were eligible to file for free using the IRS Free File program offered through TurboTax,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James' office said at the time. Under that settlement, Intuit was required to stop its ""free, free, free"" ad campaign. In its response to the administrative law judge's decision, Intuit said it expected the ruling because of the FTC's ""flawed and highly questionable process, Chair Lina Khan's previous public and prejudicial statements against Intuit, and the fact that the FTC has ruled in its own favor in nearly every consumer protection case for the last two decades."" ""We believe the FTC's decision is improper, wholly ignores the facts, and tramples on the foundations of an independent American judicial system with its serving as prosecutor, judge, and jury on its own matters,"" Intuit said.",technology
"The AI-assistant wars heat up with Claude Pro, a new ChatGPT Plus rival","Enlarge / The Anthropic Claude logo. Anthropic / Benj Edwards reader comments 8 with On Thursday, AI-maker and OpenAI competitor Anthropic launched Claude Pro , a subscription-based version of its Claude.ai web-based AI assistant, which functions similarly to ChatGPT. It's available for $20/month in the US or 18 pounds/month in the UK, and it promises five-times-higher usage limits, priority access to Claude during high-traffic periods, and early access to new features as they emerge. Like ChatGPT, Claude Pro can compose text, summarize, do analysis, solve logic puzzles, and more. Further Reading New ChatGPT rival, Claude 2, launches for open beta testing Claude.ai is what Anthropic offers as its conversational interface for its Claude 2 AI language model, similar to how ChatGPT provides an application wrapper for the underlying models GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. In February, OpenAI chose a subscription route for ChatGPT Plus , which for $20 a month also gives early access to new features, but it also unlocks access to GPT-4, which is OpenAI's most powerful language model. What does Claude have that ChatGPT doesn't? One big difference is a 100,000-token context window, which means it can process about 75,000 words at once. Tokens are fragments of words used while processing text. That means Claude can analyze longer documents or hold longer conversations without losing its memory of the subject at hand. ChatGPT can only process about 8,000 tokens in GPT-4 mode. ""The big thing for me is the 100,000-token limit,"" AI researcher Simon Willison told Ars Technica. ""That's huge! Opens up entirely new possibilities, and I use it several times a week just for that feature."" Willison regularly writes about using Claude on his blog, and he often uses it to clean up transcripts of his in-person talks. Although he also cautions about ""hallucinations,"" where Claude sometimes makes things up. ""I've definitely seen more hallucinations from Claude as well"" compared to GPT-4, says Willison, ""which makes me nervous using it for longer tasks because there are so many more opportunities for it to slip in something hallucinated without me noticing."" Enlarge / A screenshot of the public web interface for Claude 2, a large language model from Anthropic. Ars Technica Willison has also run into problems with Claude's morality filter , which has caused him trouble by accident: ""I tried to use it against a transcription of a podcast episode, and it processed most of the text before—right in front of my eyes—it deleted everything it had done! I eventually figured out that we had started talking about bomb threats against data centers towards the end of the episode, and Claude effectively got triggered by that and deleted the entire transcript."" Advertisement What does “5x more usage” mean? Anthropic's primary selling point for the Claude Pro subscription is "" 5x more usage ,"" but the company doesn't clearly communicate what Claude's free-tier usage limits actually are. Dropping clues like cryptic breadcrumbs, the company has written a support document about the topic that says, ""If your conversations are relatively short (approximately 200 English sentences, assuming your sentences are around 15–20 words), you can expect to send at least 100 messages every 8 hours, often more depending on Claude’s current capacity. Over two-thirds of all conversations on claude.ai (as of September 2023) have been within this length."" In another somewhat cryptic statement, Anthropic writes, ""If you upload a copy of The Great Gatsby , you may only be able to send 20 messages in that conversation within 8 hours."" We're not attempting the math, but if you know the precise word count of F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic, it may be possible to glean Claude's actual limits. We reached out to Anthropic for clarification yesterday and have not received a response before publication. Further Reading Anthropic’s Claude AI can now digest an entire book like The Great Gatsby in seconds Either way, Anthropic makes it clear that for an AI model with a 100,000-token context limit, usage limits are necessary because the computation involved is expensive. ""A model as capable as Claude 2 takes a lot of powerful computers to run, especially when responding to large attachments and long conversations,"" Anthropic writes in the support document. ""We set these limits to ensure Claude can be made available to many people to try for free, while allowing power users to integrate Claude into their daily workflows."" Also, on Friday, Anthropic launched Claude Instant 1.2 , which is a less expensive and faster version of Claude that is available through an API. However, it's less capable than Claude 2 in logical tasks. While it's clear that large language models like Claude can do interesting things, it seems their drawbacks and tendency toward confabulation may hold them back from wider use due to reliability concerns. Still, Willison is a fan of Claude 2 in its online form: ""I'm excited to see it continue to improve. The 100,000-token thing is a massive win, plus the fact you can upload PDFs to it is really convenient.""",technology
Record-breaking Super Mario Bros. speedrun approaches robotic perfection,"reader comments 21 with Niftski making it look easy. Further Reading How a speedrunner broke Super Mario Bros. ’ biggest barrier In 2021, when speedrunner Niftski became the first person to complete Super Mario Bros. in under 4 minutes, 55 seconds, we used the four-minute mile as a metaphor for the difficulty and importance of the achievement. But now that Niftski has pushed that time even lower—setting a new world record of 4:54.631 for a live, human-controlled full game run —we're left grasping for metaphors that accurately capture the performance. Niftski's new record perfectly matches a ""perfect"" TAS of the game (i.e., a ""tool-assisted speedrun"" that uses frame-by-frame input recordings using an emulator) through seven of the run's eight levels. His best time is now running ahead of the ""theory limit"" of 4:54.798 that runner Bismuth set back in 2018 as the ideal human performance standard. In the battle of man versus machine, Niftski is now just 0.35 seconds away from standing up, John Henry-style, against the standard of machine-made automation. Hey, I guess I did come up with a good metaphor after all. “Lightning” in a bottle Most of the tricks Niftski uses to shave off precious milliseconds in this new world record run will be well-known to speedrun fans and are outlined in our writeup of Niftski's 2021 world record performance . The major breakthrough this time around, though, is a full-game run that integrates a ""Lightning 4-2"" performance, which was thought to be humanly impossible until relatively recently. Pulling off a ""Lightning 4-2"" requires a pixel-perfect execution of the level's famous ""wrong wrap""—where going in a pipe takes the player to a warp zone that would usually require a slow climb up a vine. Pulling this off quickly requires ""bumping"" Mario against various walls and barriers mid-jump, slightly altering his position on the screen and enabling the precise positioning needed to activate the glitch. For years, the TAS of the level was just a few frames ahead of methods that were considered human-viable in a ""real-time attack"" (RTA) speedrun. But that small difference was enough for the TAS to save an entire ""frame rule"" over the best RTA times on the level, leaving humans a full 21 frames (about 0.35 seconds) behind mechanical perfection on the level thanks to the vagaries of the game's loading times. Advertisement Further Reading The best game-exploiting speedruns of Summer Games Done Quick 2022 In 2018, runner HappyLee used emulation tools to lay out a new, theoretically human-viable ""Lightning 4-2"" strategy that matched the TAS' time down to the frame. But in early 2021, Niftski used a slightly different method —integrating a pair of backward jumps over piranha plants into a wall jump off the edge of the crucial ""wrong warp"" pipe—to become the first human to match the TAS time of 25.34 seconds in an RTA of the level. Emulated perfection? Some may quibble with Niftski's use of an emulator and keyboard controls rather than a handheld controller and authentic NES hardware to achieve his record. But the community rules on Speedrun.com allow entries made with FCEUX, Nestopia, Bizhawk, or OpenEMU, all of which are considered frame-accurate enough to compare with performances on a real NES. Those emulators are also run with a special setting that prevents players from hitting both left and right on the D-pad at the same time, which is not possible on a standard NES controller. With that limitation removed, TAS runs can reduce their time to a blazing 4:54.032 . Just because Lightning 4-2 was technically possible for a human didn't mean the extremely precise sequence of inputs was reliable enough to start integrating into full-game speedruns, though. But that changed recently as runner KingOfJohnnyBoy helped develop a more consistent Lightning 4-2 method that involves bumping off of a question-mark block, rather than a moving platform, to quickly set up the crucial wrong warp"" positioning. With that new method in place, ""this framerule that was once thought to be impossible has now been implemented in runs,"" as Niftski said on YouTube. But to get the new world record, Niftski would have to pull off the extremely tricky Lightning 4-2 in a run that also included multiple ""fast acceleration"" starts and punishingly precise glitches to skip the flagpole animation at the end of each level (including an exceptionally hard one in 8-2 that requires bouncing off a precisely placed Bullet Bill). The push for perfection Enlarge / Thanks to new techniques, Niftski has now beaten the previous ""theory limit"" laid out by Youtuber Bismuth in 2018. Youtube / Bismuth The full video of Niftski stringing all that together includes a lot of extremely loud exclamations, especially after he realizes he's pulled off his second ""Lightning 4-2"" in a row during a run that has been otherwise perfect. His heart rate, as displayed on screen during the livestream, starts increasing before topping out at 188 bpm by the end of 8-4 (""I am completely healthy and do not have any heart condition!"" he assures viewers in the YouTube description). When the run is complete, Niftski pops off into a tearful, repeated exclamation of ""Oh my god!"" and tells himself to ""Get oxygen, dude"" as he realizes the enormity of what he's done. With seven ""perfect"" levels strung together in a single run, Niftski's last remaining hurdle is to put it all together with an 8-4 that is just 22 frames faster to match the TAS. That would set a record that would be literally unbeatable, even by a machine, until and unless some currently unknown strategies were discovered to save even more time. ""As much as I've stressed how amazing this run is to me, this is not my end goal, and I will not be stopping here!"" Niftski writes on YouTube. ""I plan to take this category as low as possible.""",technology
Cisco security appliance 0-day is under attack by ransomware crooks,"Enlarge / Cisco Systems headquarters in San Jose, California, US, on Monday, Aug. 14, 2023. Cisco Systems Inc. is scheduled to release earnings figures on August 16. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images reader comments 7 with Cisco on Thursday confirmed the existence of a currently unpatched zero-day vulnerability that hackers are exploiting to gain unauthorized access to two widely used security appliances it sells. The vulnerability resides in Cisco’s Adaptive Security Appliance Software and its Firepower Threat Defense, which are typically abbreviated as ASA and FTD. Cisco and researchers have known since last week that a ransomware crime syndicate called Akira was gaining access to devices through password spraying and brute-forcing. Password spraying, also known as credential stuffing, involves trying a handful of commonly used passwords for a large number of usernames in an attempt to prevent detection and subsequent lockouts. In brute-force attacks, hackers use a much larger corpus of password guesses against a more limited number of usernames. Ongoing attacks since (at least) March “An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by specifying a default connection profile/tunnel group while conducting a brute force attack or while establishing a clientless SSL VPN session using valid credentials,” Cisco officials wrote in an advisory . “A successful exploit could allow the attacker to achieve one or both of the following: Identify valid credentials that could then be used to establish an unauthorized remote access VPN session. Establish a clientless SSL VPN session (only when running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.16 or earlier). The ASA is an all-in-one security device that provides firewall, antivirus, intrusion prevention, and virtual private network protections. The FTD is Cisco’s next-generation device that combines the ASA capabilities with a finer-grained management console and other more advanced features. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-20269, stems from the devices’ improper separation of authentication, authorization, and accounting in remote access among their VPN, HTTPS management, and site-to-site VPN features. It has a severity rating of 5.0 out of a possible 10. Advertisement Researchers from security firm Rapid7 reported last week that they had observed credential-stuffing and brute-force attacks against ASA devices since at least last March. The attacks were coming from Akira and targeted devices that didn’t have multi-factor authentication enforced for some or all of its users, the researchers said. “Rapid7 identified at least 11 customers who experienced Cisco ASA-related intrusions between March 30 and August 24, 2023,” the August 29 post, headlined “Under Siege: Rapid7-Observed Exploitation of Cisco ASA SSL VPNs,” stated. “Our team traced the malicious activity back to an ASA appliance servicing SSL VPNs for remote users. ASA appliance patches varied across compromised appliances—Rapid7 did not identify any particular version that was unusually susceptible to exploitation.” The attacks, as illustrated in an image included in the Rapid7 post, often directed multiple login attempts at a target in rapid succession. While both login attempts captured in the pictured activity log were unsuccessful, attackers in some cases “successfully authenticated on the first try, which may indicate that the victim accounts were using weak or default credentials.”",technology
FAA says SpaceX has more to do before Starship can fly again,"Enlarge / A discolored plume of exhaust was visible beneath the Super Heavy booster's Raptor engines on the Starship rocket's April 20 test flight, a likely indication of a propellant leak or fire in the engine compartment. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Images reader comments 124 with The Federal Aviation Administration said Friday it has closed an investigation into the problems SpaceX encountered on its first full-scale Starship test launch in April, but federal regulators won't yet give a green light for the next Starship flight. ""The closure of the mishap investigation does not signal an immediate resumption of Starship launches at Boca Chica,"" the FAA said in a statement, referring to the location of SpaceX's Starship launch facility at Boca Chica Beach in South Texas. The nearly 400-foot-tall Starship rocket, the largest ever built, is standing on its launch pad in Texas for the upcoming test flight, which could happen before the end of this month, pending FAA approval. If all goes according to plan, the rocket's Super Heavy booster, powered by 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines, will burn for nearly three minutes, then the Starship upper stage will light its own Raptor engines to accelerate to near-orbital velocity, fast enough to send the vehicle on a flight three-quarters of the way around the world. The booster will attempt to descend to a controlled splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico, testing maneuvers for future flights to recover and reuse the rocket. But the first test flight of Starship didn't get that far. SpaceX recently submitted to the FAA the results of its investigation into the Starship test launch, which ended about four minutes after liftoff on April 20. Advertisement Multiple Raptor engines on the rocket's Super Heavy booster failed, and the vehicle lost its steering, causing it to twist out of control in the upper atmosphere. An autonomous self-destruct system issued a command to blow up the rocket, but it took longer than expected for Starship to break apart. The rocket finally disintegrated in a ball of flame. The FAA's statement Friday confirms that federal regulators have completed their review of SpaceX's mishap investigation report, which cites multiple root causes that led to the April 20 test flight ending a few minutes after liftoff. SpaceX deemed the test flight a success because it allowed engineers to gather data on the rocket's performance. The mishap investigation report itself contains SpaceX proprietary data and information governed by US export control laws and is not available for public release, according to the FAA. ""The FAA has been provided with sufficient information and accepts the root causes and corrective actions described in the mishap report,"" wrote Marcus Ward, manager of the FAA's safety assurance division, in a letter to SpaceX . ""Consequently, the FAA considers the mishap investigation that SpaceX was required to complete to be concluded."" Now SpaceX must convince the FAA it has checked off a list of corrective actions to prevent the same failures from occurring on the next Starship test flight. SpaceX said in a statement Friday that lessons learned from the April 20 launch are ""directly contributing to several upgrades being made to both the vehicle and ground infrastructure to improve the probability of success on future Starship flights.""",technology
Elon Musk's X Corp Sues California Over Content Moderation Law,"Elon Musk, a self-described free speech absolutist, bought Twitter for $44 billion last October. Elon Musk's X Corp sued California on Friday, challenging the constitutionality of a state law establishing new transparency requirements for social media companies, including how they police disinformation, hate speech and extremism. X, the social media platform once called Twitter, said the law, known as Assembly Bill 587, violates its free speech rights under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment and California's state constitution. In a complaint filed in federal court in Sacramento, California, X said the law's ""true intent"" was to pressure social media companies into eliminating content the state found objectionable. By doing so, California is forcing companies to adopt the state's views on politically charged issues, ""a form of compelled speech in and of itself,"" X said. Musk, a self-described free speech absolutist and the world's richest person, bought Twitter for $44 billion last October. He also runs the electric car company Tesla and space exploration company SpaceX. Civil rights groups including the Anti-Defamation League and the Center for Countering Digital Hate have identified increases in the volume of hate speech on X targeting Jews, Blacks, gay men and trans persons since Musk took over. The office of California Attorney General Rob Bonta, which enforces state laws, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit. AB 587 requires larger social media companies to issue semiannual reports that describe their content moderation practices, and provide data on the numbers of objectionable posts and how they were addressed. The law also requires companies to provide copies of their terms of service. Failure to comply risks civil fines of up to $15,000 per violation per day. Gavin Newsom, California's Democratic governor, signed the law last September, saying the state would not let social media be ""weaponized"" to spread hate and disinformation. Musk laid off thousands of employees after buying Twitter, and on Monday blamed critics including the ADL for a 60% decline in U.S. advertising revenue. In a recent interview, A.J. Brown, who resigned in June as X's head of brand safety and ad quality, said a recent policy change that limited the visibility of objectionable posts on X rather than removing them made it difficult to convince advertisers the platform was safe.

Over the years, we have seen this happen to the likes of MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma among others. Last Friday, it was the turn of Shubman to get covered in cake. Watch Shubman Gill's birthday celebrations below: Colombo's twilight witnessed Team India's focused training session, as they gear up for the much-awaited clash against Pakistan this Sunday! __ #AsiaCup2023 pic.twitter.com/oiJZG8cdUL — AsianCricketCouncil (@ACCMedia1) September 8, 2023 Coming back to cricket in Asia Cup 2023, Shubman did not have a great start in the tournament. He scored just 10 off 32 balls in India's opening game vs Pakistan in Kandy. He had taken time to adjust to the conditions and the pace attack but was done in by a peach from Haris Rauf that castled his stumps. In the next match vs Nepal, Gill stroked a majestic 62-ball 67 to regain his touch. His innings included 8 fours an 1 six respectively and was played with some authority. But that was a low-ranked Nepal. Pakistan are a completely different beast. Performing well against them matters and that is what Gill must intend to do when he takes the crease in the Super 4 clash vs the arch-rivals at Colombo on September 4. In case you did not know, Gill also achieved the record of fastest to reach 1500 ODI runs, taking just 29 innings to reach there. He is a quality batter and a future Indian batting star. With a double hundred already to his name and hundreds across all formats, he has the making of a superstar. Gill must ensure he raises his games in the big tournaments such as Asia Cups and World Cups to do wonders for his career and more importantly for the team.",sports
SP 500 closes up slightly ahead of US inflation data,"Wall Street The S&P 500 closed slightly higher on Friday but well below its session high and all three of Wall Street's major averages posted weekly declines as investors worried about interest rates and waited anxiously for upcoming U.S. inflation readings. Investors worried about rising oil prices and have been fretting ahead of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for August, due out on Sept. 13, seeking signals about the Federal Reserve's likely moves on interest rates. While traders bet on a roughly 93% probability the Fed keeps rates at current levels after its next meeting ends on Sept. 20., they are pricing in a more divided 53.5% chance for another pause at the November meeting, according to CME group's FedWatch Tool. Yields on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes were lower, Friday's rise in U.S. 2-year Treasury yields appeared to pressure stocks. David Lefkowitz, head of US Equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, noted investors have been increasingly concerned about rising rates since early August. ""The tone has changed in recent weeks because of the move up in rates. People are questioning whether this is a risk to economic growth. Are higher rates going to lead to some slow down in conjunction with the dwindling of excess consumer savings,"" said Lefkowitz, who also cited concerns about high valuations in equities.

Apple (AAPL.O) managed a small 0.3% gain on Friday, though its close of $178.18 was about $2 below its session high as a rally lost steam. The iPhone maker fell sharply in the previous two sessions, pushing down the broader technology sector on news that Beijing had banned central government employees from using iPhones at work. After losing 2.9% in two sessions, the S&P 500 technology sector closed higher. But energy, up 0.97%, boasted the biggest percentage gains among the 11 S&P 500's industry sectors as oil prices rose. Defensive utilities sector had a daily gain of 0.96% while the biggest decliner was real estate, which lost 0.63%.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Acquire Licensing Rights Along with three straight months of gains for crude futures and a positive start to September, this week's economic data also fueled inflation fears. Services activity data came in stronger than expected and weekly jobless claims fell. ""My expectation is that the CPI print could come in higher than expected (with) the price of oil pushing higher,"" said Phil Blancato, chief executive officer of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management. ""We have a problem where ultimately the Fed may be pushed into a corner, and while they might take a pause because of the lag effect, I don't think they're done."" Mixed comments from Fed officials have fueled uncertainty. New York Fed President John Williams kept his options open this week, while Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said that while it ""could be appropriate"" to keep rates steady at the next meeting, more tightening might be needed.

Investors can allocate 10-15% of their portfolios to gold to diversify their risk and protect their wealth against rising price pressures and economic uncertainty. On why one should apply for sovereign gold bond September 2023 tranche, Sugandha listed out the following four reasons: 1] Central banks around the world are accumulating gold in huge quantities amid growing economic uncertainties and a growing push towards de-dollarization. This is seen as a vote of confidence in gold as a safe haven asset. 2] Markets are anticipating that the US central bank is near the end of its rate hike cycle. This is good news for gold, as higher interest rates tend to weigh on gold prices. 3] Concerns about a weakening global economy are likely to sustain gold's allure as a safe haven investment. Gold is seen as a hedge against inflation and economic instability. 4] Gold prices have already corrected from their peak of Rs.61,845 per 10 gm and have been consolidating around the near-term support zone of Rs.57,500-58,000 per 10gm. This could be an opportunity for investors to add gold to their portfolios in a phased manner and sovereign gold bonds are one of the best instruments to gain exposure to gold if one has a long-term horizon.",business

"Roblox plans PlayStation debut, new world-building AI tools","Synopsis Roblox will also make its app fully available on Meta's Quest mixed reality devices this month after rolling out a test version in July. That version was downloaded more than a million times within five days, the company said in a blog post. Agencies Gaming company Roblox plans to launch its immersive digital worlds platform on Sony's PlayStation devices in October, giving it access to the hundreds of millions of people who use the world's most popular gaming consoles. Roblox will also make its app fully available on Meta's Quest mixed reality devices this month after rolling out a test version in July. That version was downloaded more than a million times within five days, the company said in a blog post. Elevate Your Tech Process with High-Value Skill Courses Offering College Course Website Indian School of Business ISB Digital Transformation Visit IIM Lucknow IIML Executive Programme in Data Science Visit Northwestern University Kellogg Post Graduate Certificate in Digital Marketing Visit Indian School of Business ISB Product Management Visit The expansion is part of a plan to make Roblox available ""anywhere users are trying to use it,"" including mobile, desktop and augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) devices, Roblox Chief Product Officer Manuel Bronstein told Reuters ahead of the company's annual developer conference this week. ""I wonder if we should be on every TV,"" Bronstein said. Roblox, with 66 million daily users, most of them teenagers, is one of the most popular gaming services for children and watched closely by tech giants like Meta as they try to entice the next generation of users. Meta's similar ""metaverse"" service Horizon, where users appearing as avatars can gather in virtual spaces, has struggled to gain similar momentum. It had fewer than 200,000 monthly users as of last year, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Discover the stories of your interest Blockchain 5 Stories Cyber-safety 7 Stories Fintech 9 Stories E-comm 9 Stories ML 8 Stories Edtech 6 Stories Horizon is currently available only in VR, although Meta said in February that it was aiming to release web and mobile versions soon, without identifying a date. At its conference, Roblox announced plans to roll out an AI-powered world-building chatbot by the end of the year. Developers will be able to use the chatbot - which closely resembles a tool previewed by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg last year - to generate virtual objects and scenes on command, without coding, according to a demo shown to Reuters. Meta's technology, which it has not yet released, used voice commands rather than written chats. Another new Roblox tool due later this year would make it possible for mobile or desktop users to conduct voice calls with Roblox friends appearing as avatars. The technology, called Connect, uses the device's camera to capture a participant's facial expressions and body movements and then displays that via the person's avatar.

Medvedev plays '12 out of 10' to take out Alcaraz,"NEW YORK -- Daniil Medvedev predicted he would need to play ""11 out of 10"" to get past defending champion and top-seeded Carlos Alcaraz at the US Open. How did Medvedev rate his performance against Alcaraz in the semifinals Friday night? ""I played 12 out of 10,"" Medvedev declared after eliminating Alcaraz 7-6 (3), 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 to set up a rematch in the final against Novak Djokovic, a 6-3, 6-2, 7-6 (4) winner over unseeded American Ben Shelton earlier Friday. The No. 3-seeded Medvedev won his lone major championship at Flushing Meadows in 2021 by defeating 23-time Slam winner Djokovic in that year's title match. That prevented Djokovic from completing what would have been the first calendar-year Grand Slam in men's tennis since 1969. Even before the start of these two weeks, folks had been anticipating a Djokovic vs. Alcaraz showdown for the title. Theirs is an intergenerational rivalry -- Djokovic is 36; Alcaraz 20 -- that has fascinated the tennis world in recent months. A meeting in New York on Sunday would have been a rematch of the final of the Cincinnati Masters last month, won by Djokovic, and of the final at Wimbledon in July, won by Alcaraz, and of a semifinal at the French Open in June, won by Djokovic. But it was not to be. Medvedev stood in the way. ""These kind of matches can happen,"" Alcaraz said. Alcaraz -- who will relinquish the No. 1 ranking to Djokovic no matter what happens on Sunday -- had been trying to become the first man to claim consecutive championships in New York since Roger Federer won five in a row from 2004 to 2008. Alcaraz spoke days earlier about his growth over the past year and how much more mature he's become. ""After this match, I'm going to change my mind,"" Alcaraz said. ""I'm not mature enough."" So instead, it will be Medvedev, a 27-year-old from Russia, who will be appearing in his third US Open final in five years and his fifth major title match in all. He lost to Rafael Nadal in New York in 2019 and at the Australian Open in 2022, and to Djokovic at the Australian Open in 2021. ""The challenge is that you play a guy that won 23 Grand Slams, and I have only one,"" Medvedev said, looking ahead to taking on Djokovic. ""When I beat him here, I managed to play better than myself, so I need to do it again. There is no other way."" Medvedev had lost to Alcaraz twice this season, including in the Wimbledon semifinals. Those head-to-head results left Medvedev concerned. ""Before the match, for sure, a lot of doubts,"" he said. But Medvedev was up to the task, defeating a world No. 1 for the sixth time -- the only active players with more wins over ATP No. 1s are Nadal (23), Djokovic (16) and Andy Murray (12) -- and continuing his unparalleled success on hard court. Since the start of 2018, nobody has recorded more match wins (235), final appearances (28) and titles (18) on hard courts than Medvedev. He stood way back to return serves and would conjure up passing shots ""from his house,"" Alcaraz observed with a smile, also noting that Medvedev hit his forehand harder than usual. One key moment: From 3-all in the opening tiebreaker, Medvedev grabbed the next four points and that set. ""I totally [lost] my mind,"" Alcaraz said. When Medvedev went up 3-0 in the second set, Alcaraz went to the sideline and thought about smacking his racket against a couple of plastic bottles on the floor near his seat, but held back. ""It was tough,"" Alcaraz said, ""for me to stay calm."" There were moments of brilliance from both men, displays of athleticism, instincts and shot-making that brought fans out of their seats. Also often jumping up from his spot in a corner guest box at Arthur Ashe Stadium was Juan Carlos Ferrero, the 2003 French Open champion who is Alcaraz's coach. Ferrero was looking nervous throughout the second set as the match appeared to be getting away from his guy, keeping up a constant patter of instructions and exhortations in Spanish. It all helped, if only briefly. Alcaraz really got going in the third set, and his net-charging tactics -- including plenty of serve-and-volleying -- were effective. He won 54 of 70 points that he finished at the net. Medvedev served about as well as ever. He saved eight of the nine break points he faced and then often got the better of the match's shortest points, winning 101 of the 174 exchanges that lasted four strokes or fewer. ""Against someone like Carlos, you have to serve well,"" Medvedev said. ""You have no other choice."" The final twist came with Alcaraz serving down 3-2 in the fourth set. It was a lengthy game that lasted nearly 15 minutes, filled with a ton of impressive returning by the lanky Medvedev, whose long arms seem to get his racket to everything. When one Medvedev return landed out, Alcaraz looked up and put his hands together, as if to say, ""Thank you!"" But Alcaraz missed one volley, and then couldn't quite deliver as he reached to try to get to a dipping, angled backhand return. ""That game was amazing,"" Medvedev would say later. It gave Medvedev the lead and an edge he would not relinquish, even if he did need to put aside a pair of double-faults while serving for the victory as some spectators called out to distract him. ""That's not so nice. But I'm happy it didn't help them,"" Medvedev said. ""They can go to sleep now."" Alcaraz was asked how long he'll stew over this setback. ""Days? Weeks? I don't know,"" he responded. ""I don't think I'm going to think about this loss for a long time."" ESPN Stats & Information and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",sports
Neymar passes Pele as top men's scorer in Brazil,"Neymar has overtaken Pele to become Brazil's all-time men's top scorer, netting twice in his national team 5-1 win in a World Cup qualifying match against Bolivia in the Amazon city of Belém. The Al Hilal forward began the World Cup two goals behind Pele, who scored 77 goals for Brazil between 1957 and 1971. Neymar now has 79 goals in 124 international appearances. - Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.) ""I never imagined reaching this record. I want to say that I am not better player than Pele,"" said Neymar after the game. ""I always wanted to make my own story, write my name in the history of Brazilian football and the national team. And today I did that."" Brazil women's forward Marta holds the country's all-time record with 115 goals in 171 games. Neymar's record-breaking goal came after a low cross into the penalty box, which the striker finished with accuracy from close range. He celebrated with a punch in the air, as Pele usually did. Earlier in the match, Neymar missed a penalty in the 17th minute, which goalkeeper Guillermo Viscarra saved. Pelé's Foundation acknowledged Neymar's achievement. ""Congratulations, Neymar Jr, for surpassing the King in goals for the Brazilian National Team in official FIFA matches,"" it said on social media. ""Surely Pelé is applauding you today!"" Pelé died from cancer Dec. 29 in Sao Paulo at the age of 82. Striker Rodrygo, who also scored two goals against Bolivia, said he's still very much a Neymar fan. ""Neymar is very much a hero of mine,"" Rodrygo said. ""This will be in my memory, this was a very special day."" New Brazil coach Fernando Diniz said Neymar came to play for Brazil ""to score goals, break records, show that he is very much willing to live this [with the national team.]"" ""He is a great hero,"" Diniz said. ""People have to recognize it and accept it. He doesn't do anything to get this adoration he gets from the crowd, it is because of the natural talent he has."" Neymar's most recent match for Brazil before the victory over Bolivia was the World Cup quarterfinal loss to Croatia. He left Qatar with doubts about his future in the national team and did not play the Selecao's first three games this year. The former Santos, Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain star scored in his Brazil debut in a 2010 friendly against the United States. Neymar guided Brazil to the Confederations Cup title in 2013 but has yet to lead them to a World Cup final, reaching quarterfinals twice -- 2018 and 2022 -- and the semifinal in 2014, when they suffered a humiliating 7-1 defeat to Germany on home soil. He missed out on Brazil's 2019 Copa America triumph through injury and was on the losing side in 2021's final against Argentina. The 31-year-old has enjoyed a glittering club career with honours, including two LaLiga titles, a Champions League trophy, five Ligue 1 titles and a Copa Libertadores.

'Virat Kohli Is Michael Jordan Of Cricket': Jumanji Star's Huge Praise,"Virat Kohli is definitely one of the greatest batters in world cricket. He has already stepped down as India captain but he continues to be a part of the team. Having a player like Virat Kohli in the squad can make any team look strong and force the opponents to take a back seat. Such is Virat Kohli's supremacy that even during his lean patch, the opponents never take him lightly. Praises are nothing new for Virat Kohli, who currently sits at the second spot in the list of international hundreds, but a recent one from a Hollywood star is special. The most recent praise for Kohli has come from Hollywood star Jack Black. He said that the right-handed batter is his ""favourite cricket player of all time"". Black even went on to compare Virat Kohli with legendary American basketball player Michael Jordan. ""I have to say though that Virat Kohli is my favourite cricket player of all time. Of all the cricket players, he is definitely the most expressive and the most passionate. He is like the Michael Jordan of cricket,"" said Black in a video that is going viral on social media. Watch it here: "" Virat Kohli is my Favourite Cricketer He's Michael Jordan of Cricket"" - Jack Black ( Hollywood Actor) pic.twitter.com/1LX2y5eQwE Virat Kohli is currently in Sri Lanka for the Asia Cup 2023. He scored only four runs in the side's campaign opener which was against Pakistan at the continental event. The Indian team has started to prepare for its second match with Pakistan in the Asia Cup 2023 in the Super Four stage which will be played on Sunday in Colombo. India had an intense practice session ahead of their clash with arch-rival Pakistan on Thursday. However, Virat Kohli and captain Rohit Sharma took rest from the optional practice session. KL Rahul who had missed the first India vs Pakistan match in the Asia Cup 2023 after he picked up a niggle, joined the nets. He practised for both left-arm pacers and right-arm pacers, keeping in mind the quality bowling attack of the Pakistan side. He spent the longest time in the nets to be fully prepared for his comeback match. Shubman Gill also faced a few balls in the nets with right-armers. He was mainly focusing on playing swing balls. Indian head coach Rahul Dravid who earlier expressed the need for India to bat a little deeper, threw balls at Shardul Thakur to prepare him to bat in the end overs to bring depth to the batting order. Dravid was also seen having a chit-chat with Shardul Thakur about his batting during the nets session. Advertisement (With ANI inputs)",sports
"When SRK told underworld , ‘ Main Pathan Hoon’","Sanjay Gupta reveals that Shah Rukh Khan was the only actor who stood upto the underworld back in the 90s when they were at the peak of their power. has currently set the box office on fire with his latest film Jawan which has grossed more than Rs 200 crore at the box office. And no one seems to have remained untouched by the magic of the film as one after one actors, producers, directors are sharing their views and reviews about the film. But director Sanjay Gupta who is known for his films like Aatish, Kaante and Kaabil shares an anecdote about the superstar as how he has always been someone who has always stood straight and looked into the eye of the problem and challenged it just like his film Jawan. With Jawan, Shah Rukh Khan has taken a stand against all the wrong that is happening in the country and urged his fans to ask questions to politicians when they come to ask for their votes next time around. Sanjay Gupta shared that at the peak of underworld bullying film stars it was only Shah Rukh Khan who stood against them. Taking to Twitter he wrote, “ I saw JAWAN. I feel compelled to share this. Back in the 90’s when the underworld bullying of the film stars was at its peak was THE ONLY star who never gave in. “Goli marni hai mar do, par tumhaare liye kaam nahin karoonga. Main Pathan hoon.” He said. He’s the same today.” Back in the 90s the underworld had suddenly realized that the movie business is one of the lucrative businesses in the country and they also wanted a share of the pie and a lot of money began flowing into the industry through them. A lot of time producers were forced to give away their overseas rights , some obliged and some didn’t and the most famous case of Gulshan Kumar’s murder has put the underworld right in the middle of the movie business.

"Djokovic hangs up on Shelton, in 10th Open final","NEW YORK -- Novak Djokovic limited big-serving Ben Shelton to five aces and broke him five times in their US Open semifinal Friday. Djokovic pushed back when the 20-year-old unseeded American produced a late stand that got the home crowd into the match. And after overcoming what he called ""a little black hole"" caused by tension to right himself, finish off a 6-3, 6-2, 7-6 (4) victory and reach his record-tying 10th final at Flushing Meadows and 36th at all major tournaments, Djokovic added a touch of insult to injury by mimicking the kid's ""Hang up the phone!"" celebration gesture. Djokovic then pointed to his temple and pounded his fist on his chest, before a stone-faced Shelton met him at the net for the most perfunctory of handshakes. A year after Djokovic could not travel to the United States for the Open because he is not vaccinated against COVID-19, the 36-year-old from Serbia is one victory away from a fourth title in New York and 24th Grand Slam championship overall. ""Well, fact is that, at 36, every Grand Slam final ... could be the last one. So I think that I probably value these occasions and opportunities to win another Slam more than I have maybe 10 years ago,"" said Djokovic, who would be the oldest man to win the US Open in the professional era, which began in 1968. ""I don't know how many I have ahead of me now."" For the third time in his career, Djokovic has made it to the finals of all four majors this season, with victories at the Australian Open in January and French Open in June. His 10th US Open final appearance ties Bill Tilden for the most by a man in tournament history. On Sunday, Djokovic will face 2021 US Open champion Daniil Medvedev, who advanced by eliminating defending champ Carlos Alcaraz 7-6 (3), 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 in the second semifinal Friday night. The No. 3-seeded Medvedev, a 27-year-old from Russia, denied Djokovic a calendar-year Grand Slam by beating him in the final at Flushing Meadows two years ago. ""The challenge is that you play a guy that won 23 Grand Slams, and I have only one,"" Medvedev said, looking ahead to taking on Djokovic. ""When I beat him here, I managed to play better than myself, so I need to do it again. There is no other way."" If Djokovic does end up leaving with the hardware this time, he would break a tie with Serena Williams for the most major singles championships in the Open era and match Margaret Court's all-time singles record. ""It's another shot for history,"" said Djokovic, who was seeded No. 2 at the US Open but will replace Alcaraz at No. 1 next week no matter what happens Sunday. Djokovic vs. Shelton certainly seemed like a mismatch beforehand: Djokovic was participating in his record 47th Slam semifinal and his 100th US Open match; the 47th-ranked Shelton was in his first major semi and only his seventh career match at the Open. Shelton won an NCAA singles title for the University of Florida last year and captured attention over the past two weeks with the powerful swings of his racket that generated a tournament-high 76 aces entering Friday, his shouts of ""Yeah!"" or biceps flexes after winning points and a victory-capping pantomime pretending his hand is an old-style telephone handset that he slams down. ""I thought it was very original, and I copied him,"" Djokovic said with a smile. ""I stole his celebration."" Shelton actually borrowed it from former Florida track and field athlete Grant Holloway, a world champion hurdler. Shelton insisted Djokovic's end-of-match gesture didn't bother him. ""I don't like when I'm on social media and I see people telling me how I can celebrate or can't celebrate. I think if you win the match, you deserve to do whatever you want,"" Shelton said. ""As a kid growing up, I always learned that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so that's all I have to say about that."" He made things interesting in the third set, lifting his level of play as Djokovic got tight when the finish line neared. Shelton broke for the only two times in the match, even held a set point at 5-4 and later erased a match point on the way to forcing the concluding tiebreaker. The fans loved it. ""It was loud,"" Shelton said. ""I mean, really loud."" But Djokovic, always so tough when the going gets tough, pulled out the win. The retractable roof was closed because of rain in the forecast, creating echoes for the soundtrack of yells and applause in Arthur Ashe Stadium, where there were additional police officers and security guards a day after four climate protesters -- including one man who glued his bare feet to the concrete in the stands -- caused a 50-minute delay during Coco Gauff's semifinal victory. In his sleeveless muscle shirt, Shelton came out smacking his high-rate lefty serves. After one at 140 mph, he shook his racket. After an ace at 145 mph, he screamed. A couple of lulls for Shelton against the relentlessly intense Djokovic shifted things early. A poor drop shot into the net here, a flubbed volley there, and Shelton got broken to trail 4-2. Djokovic strode calmly to a towel box in a corner to wipe off. Made sense: It was just 20 minutes and six games in. But the ultimate outcome never truly appeared in doubt. Well, OK, there was that little burst of excellence from Shelton after he trailed 4-2 in the last set. In the end, though, all of Djokovic's experience prevailed, along with that ability to return serves, to grind away, point after point, with his sneaker-squeaking, body-bending defense and more. ""He's a guy who can compete at the highest level, has a similar mentality to me on the court, with how he wants to come after you and be aggressive and show his emotion,"" Shelton said. ""It was really cool to see that matchup for the first time. Looking forward to hopefully getting it again."" ESPN Stats & Information and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",sports
Katrina wants to avoid overexposure before Tiger 3,"Katrina Kaif is staying away from the media in a planned way as she has two back to back films lined up in Tiger 3 and Merry Christmas and wants to avoid overexposure wants to avoid overexposure before Tiger 3 Katrina Kaif over the years has emerged as one of the most hard working and competent performers in the entertainment industry. Her fan following on Instagram is a sure sign of how famous she is. The actress though has been keeping a low profile off late. Besides acting she also has her beauty and make-up brand to take care of but insiders feel that her staying away from the media is a planned move. The actress who has been part of the movie business for more than 15 years, got married to her husband Vicky Kaushal in 2021 and post that she has had only one release in Phone Bhoot. The film also starred Siddhant Chaturvedi and Ishaan Khatter and the film failed to do magic at the box office. Since then the actress has been shooting for two films, one being the third installment of the Tiger series called Tiger 3 where she will be reprising the role of Zoya with . Another being Merry Christmas with Vijay Sethupati ,which is directed by Sriram Raghavan after Andhadhun. Now as per a report by Bollywood Life, Katrina who was last spotted at a private screening for the cast and crew of Jawan at Yash Raj Studios is staying away from the media on purpose. The report claims that after a very long time the actress has multiple releases in the same year and both are big ticket films as Tiger 3 takes the SPY universe story ahead and Merry Christmas will be released in Hindi and Tamil as two separate films. So she is avoiding to get overexposed in the time being as she will need to be out and about during promotions of both these films. Katrina is supposed to be part of Farhan Akhtar’s Je Lee Zaraa where she will be seen with Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Alia Bhatt. But it seems the film has been put on the backburner as the three actresses can’t seem to be matching dates for the film to go on floors.

Animal's teaser to drop on Ranbir's birthday,"Teaser of Ranbir Kapoor's Animal will be dropping on his birthday 28th September. The film is directed by Sandeep Vanga Reddy of Kabir Singh fame and is produced by Bhushan Kumar. Ranbir Kapoor’s last release was Tu Jhoothi Main Makkar which presented him in the lover boy role but for his next he is going in the absolute opposite direction. His next is Sandeep vanga Reddy’s Animal which as per many insiders is one of the most violent films of Sandeep and Ranbir’s career. The film also has a stellar support cast in Anil Kapoor, Bobby Deol and Rashmika Mandana . The film was scheduled to release on August 11 where it was to clash with Gadar 2. But the makers later decided to move to 1st December as the work on post production was not complete. Director Sandeep in a video released by him shared the reason for the delay . ""I’m making this video for two reasons. One is that I’m going to explain why we aren’t able to achieve the film release on August 11. And another one is that I’m going to announce the new release date. Coming back to the topic of why we are not able to release the film on August 11, the only reason is, and it might sound like a generic answer, the quality. See, I’m not going to explain to you how the post-production work has been delayed as it might bore you. I’ll cut it short. I’ll give you one example,"" Sandeep said. He added , ''There are seven songs in the film, when seven songs multiply into five languages it becomes 35 songs. 35 songs, different set of lyricists, a different set of singers, it's going to take a little more time than what I actually planned for."" But we are learning thanks to a report by Pinkvilla that the makers of the film are working on a teaser of the film that will be released on Ranbir Kapoor’s birthday 28th September. It will be a gift to Ranbir and to his fans.Which means promotion of the film will begin at least 2 months before the release of the film. Trade is very gung ho about the film and is expecting tremendous business for the film. The film when announced had Parineeti Chopra attached to it, but later she dropped out of the film and was replaced by Rashmika.Ranbir also would be eagerly waiting for the film as he hasn’t signed on any other project after the release of Tu Jhoothi Main Makkar. The synopsis of the film reads as ‘A gangster drama that explores the turbulent relationships between all the characters that eventually lead to the protagonist becoming an 'animal' in nature.’ india india india Food india india india india india",entertainment
Surmounting the acoustic barrier with neural implants and the bionic ear,"The burden of hearing loss in India is significant as it is one of the most common congenital anomalies to affect children. The World Health Organisation reports that severe to profound hearing loss affects nearly 2 - 3 per 1000 live births, making it the most common congenital abnormality to affect newborns the world over. This scenario is even more pronounced in developing countries such as the Indian sub-continent, especially with the continuing problem of consanguinous marriages. Hearing loss at birth is considered a social stigma even in present-day society and results in a double tragedy, as it leads to not only deafness but also speech and language deprivation and communication problems. In the past, individuals with severe to profound hearing loss with no benefit from hearing aids were condemned to live in a world of silence. However, hearing loss today, is the only truly remediable handicap, due to remarkable advances in biomedical engineering and surgical techniques. Rather than mend a diseased organ, the emphasis has shifted to bypassing it with a bionic prosthetic device. Cochlear implants (CI) can help deafened individuals living in a world of silence enter the world of sound. The advent of this technology has successfully broken the acoustic barrier, thus integrating people with hearing loss into normal society and providing them with a highly productive quality of life. CIs help augment or restore hearing by integrating with an external circuitry with the peripheral hearing apparatus and the central circuitry of the brain. They are bio-compatible and safe as well as extremely effective in restoring hearing to both children and adults with severe - profound hearing loss, who do not receive benefit from conventional hearing aids. These implantable devices electronically stimulate the cochlear nerve (nerve of hearing), bypassing the damaged hair cells of the cochlea (inner ear). Thus, hearing restoration is the first successful attempt in medical science to integrate an electronic device with the central nervous system, in order to fully restore a lost special sense organ. CIs are electronic devices with external and internal components and are designed to detect mechanical sound energy and convert it into electrical signals that can be delivered to the cochlear nerve. These electrical signals are processed by an external speech processor and sent via a radiofrequency interface into an array of electrodes implanted surgically within the cochlea (inner ear). The individual’s ability to adjust to, interpret and respond to the electrical stimulus can determine outcomes. Length of time spent without sound stimulation, presence or absence of previous experience with sound, personal motivation, community or family support, and opportunities for habilitation have been shown to be important factors in achieving a good outcome. Early identification and management of hearing loss is extremely important for good outcomes with a CI. All children below the age of six years who have profound hearing loss and who will not benefit from conventional hearing aids and all adults who have lost hearing after the acquisition of language are ideal candidates. Presently, the indications for CI have expanded to include children aged one year or less, elderly individuals, children with abnormal cochlea, additional handicaps, etc. The recent trend is towards cochlear implantation in both ears which provides improved localisation of sound and enhanced ability to hear in the presence of background noise. For long it was believed that natural hearing was not compatible and could not co-exist with bionic hearing through a cochlear implant. This myth has fortunately been laid to rest in recent years with the advent of electro-acoustic stimulation (EAS) or hybrid implants. This application of implantable hearing technology combines a hearing aid and a cochlear implant (EAS) into a hybrid device designed for individuals with low-frequency hearing and severe-to-profound high-frequency hearing loss. The switch-on of the device is done three weeks after surgery once the wound has healed. Mapping is done at periodic intervals and prolonged and intensive habilitation after cochlear implantation is essential. Habilitation aims at improving receptive language skills and expressive skills. In Tamil Nadu, the cochlear implant program has been very successful as free cochlear implants are being sponsored to children under the age of six years and below the poverty line. Nearly 5000 CIs have therefore been performed in Tamil Nadu under the Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme. CI surgery and technology continue to evolve. Rapid technological advancements in bioengineering and implant manufacturing methods have led to miniaturization of the device, with refinement in sound signals, providing better “hearing in noise” and music appreciation among cochlear implantees. Robotic techniques for surgery may be available in the near future. Fully implanted devices, improved speech coding strategies, nanotechnology, stem cell therapy, cochlear hair cell regeneration, and nerve growth factors used in conjunction with an implant may be available in the future. Rapid advances in genetics are revolutionizing our understanding of congenital deafness and should play an important part in prevention, in the selection of patients and in determining CI outcomes. Gene therapy for hearing impairment may become available. A novel imaging technique, synchrotron radiation phase-contrast imaging to look into the interior of the cochlea with unprecedented detail will result in an improved understanding of the microanatomy of the ear and improve management of hearing loss. Artificial intelligence is also playing an important role in improving patient outcomes. The cochlear implant is one of the most significant innovations of the last century making hearing the only sense that can be replicated through a medical device. Developments in technology will expand the benefit of cochlear implants. A full spectrum of hearing solutions is now available in the Indian subcontinent. Despite several challenges, cochlear implantation in India is a success story.

7th Pay Commission DA Hike Soon: How Much Salary Hike Expected for Central Govt Employees?,"7th Pay Commission: Even as the central government employees are waiting for DA hike, the government is soon likely to announce the latest dearness allowance. The DA hike, which will be effective from July 1, 2023, is expected to be 3 per cent, according to media reports. After the increase, the dearness allowance will reach 45 per cent. Going by the media reports of a 3 per cent DA hike, how much is the salary hike likely? If somebody’s salary is Rs 50,000 per month and has Rs 15,000 as the basic pay. He or she will now get Rs 6,300, which is 42 per cent of the basic pay. However, after the expected 3 per cent hike, the employee will get Rs 6,750 per month, which is Rs 450 higher. So, if someone has a Rs 50,000 salary a month with Rs 15,000 as the basic pay, his or her salary will rise by Rs 450 per month. The dearness allowance for employees and pensioners is worked out on the basis of the latest Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers (CPI-IW) brought out by the Labour Bureau every month. The Labour Bureau is a wing of the Labour Ministry. According to the latest data, the All-India CPI-IW for July 2023 rose 3.3 points to 139.7. On 1-month percentage change, it increased by 2.42 per cent with respect to previous month compared to increase of 0.90 per cent recorded between corresponding months a year ago. DA is given to government employees, while DR is given to pensioners. DA and DR are hiked twice a year — January and July. Currently, over one crore central government employees and pensioners are getting a 42 per cent dearness allowance. Last month, All India Railwaymen Federation General Secretary Shiva Gopal Mishra told PTI that the Federation is demanding a four percentage point hike in dearness allowance. But, the dearness allowance hike works out to be a little over three percentage points. “DA is likely to be increased by three percentage points to 45 per cent."" He also said the expenditure department of the finance ministry will formulate a proposal to hike DA along with its revenue implication and will put up the proposal before the Union Cabinet for approval. In the last hike in March 2023, the DA was increased by 4 per cent to 42 per cent. Given the current inflation rate, the next DA hike is expected to be 4 per cent, as per various reports. Recently, various state governments, including Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Karnataka, Jharkhand and Himachal Pradesh, increased dearness allowance for their state government employees. How Does Government Decide On The DA Hike? The DA and DR hike is decided based on the percentage increase in 12 monthly average of the All India Consumer Price Index (AICPI) for the period ending June 2022. Though the central government revises the allowances on January 1 and July 1 every year, the decision is generally announced in March and September. In 2006, the central government had revised the formula to calculate the DA and DR for central government employees and pensioners. Dearness Allowance Percentage = ((Average of All-India Consumer Price Index (Base Year 2001=100) for the past 12 months -115.76)/115.76)x100. For Central public sector employees: Dearness Allowance Percentage = ((Average of All-India Consumer Price Index (Base Year 2001=100) for the past 3 months -126.33)/126.33)x100.",business
"Small Savings Schemes: Govt Likely To Keep Interest Rates Unchanged For October-December 2023, Says Expert","Even as the interest rates on small savings schemes, including PPF, NSC and KVP, are reviewed every quarter, the government will revise interest rates on such schemes for October-December 2023 at the end of this month — September 29 or September 30. An expert said that going by the G-Sec yields trend, the interest rates on small savings schemes are likely to remain unchanged. Paras Jasrai, senior analyst at India Ratings & Research, said, “The interest rates on these schemes (small savings schemes) are decided on the previous quarter’s trend of G-Sec (government securities) yield. The 10-year G-Sec has ranged between 7.0 per cent and 7.2 per cent in the current fiscal so far, and is expected to be around 7.1 per cent-7.2 per cent, as inflation is expected to be in the range of 5-6 per cent post September 2023. So, the interest rates on small savings schemes are likely to be unchanged."" Currently, interest rates on small savings schemes range between four per cent (post office savings deposits) and 8.2 per cent (Senior Citizens Savings Scheme). What Are Small Savings Schemes? Small Savings Schemes are savings instruments managed by the government to encourage citizens to save regularly. The small savings schemes have three categories — savings deposits, social security schemes and monthly income plan. Saving deposits include 1-3-year time deposits and 5-year recurring deposits. These also include saving certificates such as National Saving Certificates (NSC) and Kisan Vikas Patra (KVP). Social security schemes include Public Provident Fund (PPF), Sukanya Samriddhi Account and Senior Citizens Savings Scheme. The monthly income plan includes the Monthly Income Account. What Are The Current Interest Rates On Small Savings Schemes? The interest rates for the current quarter July-September 2023 are as follows: In the last review on June 30, 2023, the government hiked interest rates on several small savings schemes — 1-year & 2-year post office time deposits and 5-year recurring deposits. It was the fourth hike since September 2022, when the government raised interest rates on some small savings schemes for the October-December 2022 quarter, after keeping it unchanged for nine consecutive quarters — from the second quarter of 2020-21 to the second quarter of 2022-23.",business
"WC Ticket Fiasco? 'Can't Give Fans False Assurance,' Ex-India Star Fumes","Amid the dearth of ICC Cricket World Cup tickets in the market, former India pacer Venkatesh Prasad has voiced his displeasure over the handling of the matter. Prasad's reaction comes after fans, who according to him are the biggest stakeholders of the game, slammed the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), International Cricket Council (ICC) and BookMyShow, the official ticketing partner, over the distribution of tickets. Fans were left empty handed, despite waiting in the queue for hours on the official site, as the tickets were sold at a rate of knots. Reacting to the fiasco, Prasad demanded a proper audit over the distribution of the tickets in order to identify the culprit behind the dearth of tickets for the mega event. ""This doesn't look good. Either the ticket partners are incompetent to handle the ticket and traffic or this is another eyewash in the name of releasing tickets. Hope there is a proper audit and identification of how the tickets are sold and to whom and what platform. Just cannot take the biggest stakeholders, the fans for a ride with false assurances,"" Prasad replied to BCCI's post on X. Notably, BookMyShow's website showed a waiting time of just 90 minutes, but the fans had to wait for much longer while booking the tickets. Earlier, Due to the high demands of tickets, the BCCI decided to release 400,000 fresh tickets for fans.

Does vagus nerve dysfunction have a connection with COVID-19?,"The story so far: There’s been a lot of chatter online of late, about the vagus nerve: ways to stimulate it, and the possible benefits of this stimulation to help with health problems ranging from anxiety to obesity. Videos abound with suggestions for stimulation, including yoga and plunging your face into cold water, alongside sales of little devices that send electrical impulses travelling into your brain. Recent research has also indicated a link between vagus nerve dysfunction and long COVID . They’re actually a pair of nerves, one on each side, that run from your brainstem, through the neck, to your chest and stomach. They form a key part of the parasympathetic nervous system, the system that is responsible for relaxing and resting your body after a bout of activity, and for a number of vital functions including your heart rate, blood pressure and digestion; it also plays a role in the immune system. There are many things that make the vagus nerve fascinating to researchers. The vagal nerves are the longest cranial nerves, going from your brain to your large intestine, fulfilling their meaning (‘vagus’ in Latin means ‘wandering’) by passing through, or connecting with your neck, heart, lungs, abdomen and digestive tract – all important parts. (For top health news of the day, subscribe to our newsletter Health Matters) They are the 10 th of your 12 cranial nerves and contain 75% of your parasympathetic nervous system’s nerve fibre. They work bi-directionally, allowing the brain and body to communicate with each other. And so, researchers are increasingly looking at ways through which stimulation of these nerves, our ‘sensory superhighways’, thereby triggering the parasympathetic nervous system, may potentially help with various health conditions. Some of these treatments are already in existence, for instance, an implantable vagus nerve stimulator is used to treat epilepsy and depression (that does not respond to conventional treatment), by stimulating areas of the brain that lead to seizures and affect moods. There are now also non-invasive devices that can be held against the skin for stimulation. One finding about the vagus nerve was that it also regulates inflammation: the body, in response to an infection, gets temporarily inflamed , but once the infection is dealt with, the vagus nerve helps bring the body back to normal by suppressing inflammation. This, researchers believe, could have potential implications in helping to treat several conditions. ALSO READ | Long COVID: a lingering problem requiring greater attention Vagus nerve stimulation is also being studied for a host of other diseases and disorders such as migraines, polycystic ovary syndrome, alcoholism, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis and gut disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease and Crohn’s disease. A study posted on the Preprints with Lancet server in June this year, took a look at patients with Post-Covid-19 Condition (PCC) or long COVID . It attempted to find out whether the dysfunction of the vagus nerve could be responsible for the symptoms these patients experienced, including persistent dysphonia (hoarseness), dysphagia (swallowing difficulties), dizziness, shortness of breath, fast heart rates and gastrointesitnal disturbances. The study found that those with PCC were more likely to have vagus nerve-related symptoms, compared to those who had recovered from COVID-19 and those not infected, indicating that vagus nerve dysfunction could have a role in the pathophysiology of PCC, the paper states. The study, also presented at this year’s European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases suggested that many of the symptoms connected to PCC could be linked to the effect of the coronavirus on the vagus nerve. Other research papers have also looked at impaired vagal activity in long COVID patients , as well as potential therapeutic approaches that include vagal nerve stimulation. Google the above question and you’ll get a ton of answers. An article on the Cleveland Clinic’s website details five fairly simple methods: meditation – with exhales longer than inhales; exercise, to get your body active and moving; massage such as reflexology; music through humming and singing, and the popular icy water immersion or placing a cold pack on your face. Implanted vagus nerve stimulation does not work for everybody, and is not intended to replace conventional treatment, states the Mayo Clinic’s website. It is an adjuvant treatment for most conditions, not a primary treatment, says E.S. Krishnamoorthy, neuropsychiatrist and founder, Buddhi Clinic, Chennai. VNS is still being studied and, more research is needed into its potential therapeutic effects for various conditions. Dr. Krishnamoorthy also cautions that stimulation of the vagus nerve with a device (many seem to be available on commercial platforms) must not be done at home. Since the nerve regulates the heartbeat and blood pressure, cardiac clearance is needed for this, Dr. Krishanmoorthy, who uses this method as part of broader treatment regimens, explains. “There are inhibitory and stimulatory protocols that have to be followed while using these devices, and so it has to be done at a clinic, under a doctor’s supervision.”",technology
Former India Left-Arm Spinner Sridharan Sriram Joins Lucknow Super Giants As Assistant Coach for IPL 2024,"Sridharan Sriram, the former India left-arm spinner, has joined Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) as the assistant coach for the upcoming season, the franchise said on Saturday. LSG had earlier appointed Justin Langer as their new head coach, replacing Andy Flower.

Vijay Dahiya and Pravin Tambe continue in their roles as assistant coach and spin bowling coach respectively, while the South African duo of Morne Morkel and Jonty Rhodes carry on as the team's bowling coach and fielding coach,” added the franchise in a statement. Sriram, who played eight ODIs for India from 2000-04, had been Australia’s assistant coach for six years, before leaving the role in 2022. He first came into the Australian set-up as a spin coach under then head-coach Darren Lehmann in 2016. Sriram, who played domestic cricket for Tamil Nadu, as well as for Maharashtra, Goa, Assam and Himachal Pradesh in his playing career, is known to have a huge influence on leg-spinner Adam Zampa, left-arm spinner Ashton Agar, and veteran off-spinner Nathan Lyon, plus improving part-time spin of Glenn Maxwell.

India Likely Playing XI vs Pakistan in Asia Cup 2023 Super Four: KL Rahul to Make Comeback? Check Predicted Indian 11 for Cricket Match in Colombo,"India are all set to square off against Pakistan in the Asia Cup 2023 Super Four clash on Sunday, September 10 at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. Pakistan have been at their vintage best in the Asia Cup 2023 so far. Even in their previous match against Bangladesh, they put up a clinical performance and won the game by seven wickets. Hence, when India takes the field alongside the Men in Green on Sunday, they need to at their best to trump Babar Azam & Co. Moreover, the last time both teams clashed in the group stage, Pakistan bowlers gave India's top order a tough time. Hence, the Men in Blue will be required to bring their A-game in the forthcoming encounter. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh Cricket Boards Issue Statements Following Controversial India vs Pakistan Reserve Day in Asia Cup 2023 As India gear up for their first Super Four of the 16th edition of the continental tournament, they will have received a big boost with the arrival of KL Rahul. Also, Jasprit Bumrah has returned after the birth of his baby and will be available for the match. However, with the arrival of the duo, the team management will need to brainstorm over their team combination. In Rahul's absence, Ishan Kishan has been the first-choice wicketkeeper of the Indian team and the southpaw has been brilliant with bat. Even in the clash against Pakistan, he scored a blistering half-century. Thus, it will be interesting to see if India picks Rahul at the expense of Kishan.

"Vodafone Idea Pays 50% License Fees, Spectrum Usage Charges For March Quarter: Report","Vodafone Idea (VI) has paid 50 per cent of its license fees and spectrum usage charges (SUC) owed for the March quarter, reported The Economic Times (ET). Additionally, they have also assured the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) that they will clear 90 per cent of the dues for the June quarter, including interest payments, in a phased manner, the report said citing DoT officials. According to the company's first-quarter earnings, VI's total gross debt as of June 30, 2023 stood at Rs 2,117.6 billion which includes deferred spectrum payment obligations of Rs 1,337.4 billion, AGR liability of Rs. 668.6 billion that is due to the government, debt from banks and financial institutions of Rs. 95 billion and optionally convertible debentures amounting to Rs. 16.6 billion. The report said that DoT officials said that as long as the company adheres to its payment schedules, the department will refrain from using the bank guarantees. However, if the company fails to meet its commitments, the guarantees will be cashed. ""They (Vi) have written to us that significant progress has been made with several groups of investors but nothing specific has been informed by the company,"" an official told the ET. ""Once the promoters infuse the Rs 2,000 crore into the company, there may be some movement on external funding,"" another government official was quoted as saying. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); The report noted that as of now the government holds the largest stake in the company at 33.1 per cent. However, it maintains a hands-off approach to the company's day-to-day operations. Over the past two years, the government has granted several extensions for statutory payments, given that VI has been paying interest to compensate for the delays. Additionally, recent telecom reforms have eliminated provisions for imposing penalties.

This financial constraint puts VI at a disadvantage compared to competitors such as Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel. According to the report, VI CEO Akshaya Moondra has told DoT that they are close to arranging a Rs 4,000-crore short-term loan from the SBI to pay for its pending statutory dues as well as spectrum installment. The company has requested a 30-day extension to fulfill its payment obligation for the 2022 spectrum auction installment. The original due date for this installment, amounting to Rs 1,680 crore, was set for August 17. However, Vodafone Idea (VI) has been granted a 30-day extension, subject to interest charges. Notably, while the government had provided a four-year payment moratorium for payments related to past auctions, the 2022 spectrum auction was not included in this arrangement. The payment moratorium is set to end in the third quarter of the 2025-26 fiscal year. Following this, VI will be required to make annual regulatory payments exceeding Rs 40,000 crore, the report said.",business

"EXCLUSIVE: Shah Rukh Khan’s body double Prashant Walde shares FASCINATING trivia about how Jawan was shot: “The blast that took place in the scene in the government hospital was quite risky. In 18 seconds, 28 blasts were carried out”","Shah Rukh Khan’s Jawan is doing record business. A lot of people contributed big time to the film, apart from its leading actors, directors etc. One of them is Shah Rukh Khan’s body double Prashant Walde. He spoke exclusively to Bollywood Hungama about his experience of working on the film and a lot more. EXCLUSIVE: Shah Rukh Khan’s body double Prashant Walde shares FASCINATING trivia about how Jawan was shot: “The blast that took place in the scene in the government hospital was quite risky. In 18 seconds, 28 blasts were carried out” Prashant Walde began by talking about having a bald look. He said, “For the first time, I did such prosthetic make-up in my life. We shot for almost a month in this look. I used to get boils as chemicals are used in prosthetic make-up. My skin used to get burnt. If the prosthetics were applied on alternate days, then it would not be a problem.” He said his family members were amused by his bald look, “ Unko dekh ke maza aata tha . It’s a work that requires the utmost attention. Agar theek se nahin kiya, toh fatt jaata tha . It takes 2-3 hours. There were times when Shah Rukh bhai used to look at my prosthetics and remark, ‘ Tera toh bada accha laga hua hai’ ! Toh bada taam jaam rehta tha set pe !” Prashant continued, “There was a lot of detailing. They made sure that the shade of the bandage didn't change. Even for the old look, a lot of care was taken. Atlee sir used to keep an eye on these details.” View this post on Instagram A post shared by Prashant Walde (@prashantwalde) He went on praising the blockbuster director, “Atlee sir worked with a lot of dedication and we can see today how it has worked big time. And of course, Shah Rukh bhai also gave his life and soul to the film. He had to face several problems during the course of the shoot. In our hearts, we knew that yeh film dhamaal karne waali hai ! And that’s what happened. Until now, Bollywood had never seen a film like this. Everyone is unanimously saying that this is Shah Rukh Khan’s best film!” Prashant Walde added, “Even when we shot for the first teaser, I got a feeling from inside that Jawan will create history. I told this even to Shah Rukh bhai’s team. They used to tell me, ‘Prashant, chup reh. Nazar mat laga ’ (laughs)!” Explaining why he felt so, he explained, “I have done many films and ads in 17 years. But the experience and vibe of Jawan were something else. Atlee sir’s shift used to be for 12 hours but we would end up working for 14 hours. I don't remember the shoot getting over in 12 hours ever! We used to be tired and yet, we couldn’t wait to report to the set the next day. Atlee sir would tell me, 'Tum monitor pe baithe raho. Kabhi bhi zarurat pad sakti hai '. I had no qualms as I had never seen such direction before. His whole team was also quite dedicated. In Bollywood, jo humein diya gaya hai, log wohi kaam karte hai in terms of the breakdown of scenes. But Atlee sir and his team used to always wonder how they could make the scene better. Everyone on the set was always running as if they’ll miss the train if they slow down!” He further stated, “Atlee sir ko jo chahiye, agar unhe us cheez ko Shah Rukh bhai nahin dete the , toh Atlee sir khud karke dikhate the . And Shah Rukh bhai would surrender. He ensured he delivered as per Atlee sir's requirement. Both would never compromise. The dedication of Atlee sir and hard work of Shah Rukh bhai...you had to see it to believe it.” Prashant Walde also revealed that Atlee was a stickler for punctuality, “Once, there was a major traffic jam around Kalina University due to Maharashtra’s former Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray's visit. I got stuck. Our call time was at 6:00 pm. Suddenly, I saw Atlee sir speedily walking towards the shoot venue. I called him and asked him to join me in the car. But he politely declined, saying that he was late. He walked a great distance since he realised he'd reach faster on foot.” View this post on Instagram A post shared by Prashant Walde (@prashantwalde) At Kalina University, the scene of the hospital in the first half was shot. Prashant Walde revealed, “The blast that took place in the scene in the government hospital was quite risky. In 18 seconds, 28 blasts were carried out. We all were told to stay as far away as possible due to the risk. But I said, 'Mujhe toh dekhna hai' ! And it was quite a sight. Aise khatarnaak blasts hue the ! There were so many camera setups and other preparations that they had to do it in one take. And they managed to do so.” Prashant Walde then mentioned about the climax scene, comprising Azad and Vikram Rathore, both of which were played by Shah Rukh Khan. He said, “Sometimes, Shah Rukh bhai used to shoot for the young character, that is, Azad’s portions. At times, he used to play Vikram Rathore. If he’s playing Vikram, I would be performing the role of Azad and vice versa.” Prashant then praised Vijay Sethupathi, “Vijay Sethupathi ji would deliver dialogues in Tamil. He would then memorize dialogues in Hindi and deliver the lines. However, at times, the energy or feel would be less than what it was when he said the lines in Tamil. He used to ask Shah Rukh bhai constantly, ‘Is this okay? Better?’. Shah Rukh bhai would reply, ‘Yes, better than the previous shot’. This would lead to a lot of retakes.” He continued, “The scene where he’s about to shoot Vikram Rathore just before the latter gets his memory, everyone on the set, comprising 1000-1500 people, clapped after Vijay Sethupathi ji delivered the lines in Hindi. His secretary was well-versed in the language. She used to categorically tell him if the Hindi dialogues weren’t delivered properly by him. Though he had got claps, he still went for a retake (after she gave her feedback). In the previous take, he had given 40% energy. In the next take, he gave more than 100% energy. Shah Rukh then felt that even he should perform energetically. Atlee sir, however, told him that it’s not needed as per the scene and his Azad character. Atlee sir also told me to stand in one shot opposite Vijay Sethupathi ji. It was a lot of fun.” Finally, Prashant Walde is content that Jawan has worked big time, “We are a very small part of the film. But I am happy to see that Jawan is so well received. Itni mehnat karne ke baad upar waale ne fal de diya! Also with Gadar 2 and many other films also doing well, the industry will benefit immensely. So many people will get work.” As for what next, he replied, “After Pathaan and Jawan , I am sure Shah Rukh bhai’s next Dunki will also be a blockbuster!” View this post on Instagram A post shared by Prashant Walde (@prashantwalde) Also Read: Shah Rukh Khan responds to Anand Mahindra after he calls Jawan star a “natural resource”: “I keep trying in my small humble way to make our country proud in terms of making cinema” More Pages: Jawan Box Office Collection , Jawan Movie Review Tags : Atlee Kumar , Body Double , Features , Jawan , Nayanthara , Prashant Walde , Red Chillies Entertainment , Shah Rukh Khan , SRK , Vijay Sethupathi BOLLYWOOD NEWS - LIVE UPDATES Catch us for latest Bollywood News , New Bollywood Movies update, Box office collection , New Movies Release , Bollywood News Hindi , Entertainment News , Bollywood Live News Today & Upcoming Movies 2023 and stay updated with latest hindi movies only on Bollywood Hungama.",entertainment
"EXCLUSIVE: “With Jawan, Shah Rukh Khan is saying, ‘I am not going back’,” asserts Taran Adarsh","Shah Rukh Khan’s latest release Jawan has shattered the box office by creating a new opening day record of Rs. 65.50 crore. In this way, the actor has broken his own opening day record of Rs. 57 crores, which he achieved earlier this year with Pathaan . In an exclusive chat with Bollywood Hungama , veteran trade analyst Taran Adarsh spoke about what this means to the industry. EXCLUSIVE: “With Jawan, Shah Rukh Khan is saying, ‘I am not going back’,” asserts Taran Adarsh He said, “What an opening! It’s Rs. 65.50 crores, which is 19% higher than Pathaan , which was the highest ever at Rs. 57 crores. Just imagine if it was a holiday. So the potential of the film is Rs. 70-75 crores on any single day. Of course, it was a part holiday but its Shah Rukh Khan… Everyone said that it’s his comeback with Pathaan . And with Jawan he is saying, ‘I am not going to go back.’” Some time back, Taran Adarsh had predicted such an opening for Jawan . Recalling that, he said, “I was very confident not because of my prediction or whatever; I don’t want to give myself any credit for that. I would say only one person (made it possible) – Shah Rukh Khan himself. I feel whatever collection you are witnessing, it’s because of this force called Shah Rukh Khan. As I have always said, he is number one to number five. We can’t even give rankings to him. He has reached that stage.” He added, “I would like to tell you that he has brought so much happiness to the industry in terms of box office numbers. Pathaan and Jawan have had such fantabulous starts at the box office. It’s a whole circle in the film industry, which benefits from a good opening.” Generally, in a masala film, one is advised to keep logic at home. However, Adarsh feels that one shouldn’t do this with Jawan because it’s much more than just a massy entertainer. “Here we need to advise people to take their brains with them because the film has a lot of messages from start to end,” he added. Directed by Atlee Kumar and produced by SRK’s Red Chillies Entertainment, Jawan also stars Nayanthara, Vijay Sethupathi, Sanya Malhotra, Priya Mani, among others.

Sri Lanka Coach Chris Silverwood Expects Explosive Finish From Dasun Shanaka and Dhananjaya De Silva Ahead of SL vs BAN Asia Cup Super Four Match,"Ahead of the Super Four stage match between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, Sri Lanka head coach Chris Silverwood said that they are working on their batting order. Dhananjaya de Silva is currently batting at No. 6 with an average of 26.04 and a strike rate of 74.93. Captain Dasun Shanaka batting at No. 7 averages 25.43 and strikes at 86.59. Both fall far short of the best finishers in international cricket. ‘Also Would Have Liked To Have One,’ Says Bangladesh Coach Chandika Hathurasingha After India vs Pakistan Asia Cup 2023 Super Four Match Given Reserve Day . ""Dasun is working very hard at the moment, as he always does. We're working hard with him at the moment so he can get the runs that we know he can,"" Silverwood said as quoted by ESPNcricinfo. ""We think at No. 7 he can make real strong contributions for us, and help build on the good starts that we've been getting. We've been getting into positions we could launch from, and it'd be great to see Dasun really hurt the opposition and get us over that 300 mark."" The SL coach said that he wants batters at 6 and 7 to bat explosively in the end. ""With the two of them sat at [Nos.] 6 and 7, we want them to provide firepower. It's not just a case of going out there and slogging. It's about doing it their way, and hitting their strong shots. And making sure that they have a clear plan of how they're going to execute that. As we've seen in the past, Dhananjaya has been very good at getting us out of a hole, and getting us to a score that we can then defend,"" he added. ""I think Bangladesh have got a very strong bowling unit. From what I've seen so far, in this competition, I've been very impressed with them - particularly the pace bowlers,"" Silverwood said. ""They're big, they're strong, they're accurate, and they get movement. We have to make sure we prepare well and make sure that every batter on our side has a plan on how to cope with every bowler on their side. Silverwood, however, singled out Bangladesh's seamers as a particular threat ahead of Saturday's match in an Asia Cup that has so far been a showcase of superb fast bowling. The tracks in Colombo are likely to be slower than those in Pallekele, but with rain in the forecast, quick bowlers could play important roles. Virat Kohli Gifted Silver Bat by Budding Cricketers From Sri Lanka Ahead of IND vs PAK Asia Cup 2023 Super Four Match . ""We've been watching Bangladesh and preparing well. It's a different surface here compared to Kandy. We'll have to make sure that our combinations are right for this wicket,"" Silverwood concluded.

The side has embarked upon a path of high performance after years of rebuilding. In the Asia Cup, they have defeated Bangladesh and Afghanistan so far although the latter was a close contest which could have gone either way. Opponents Bangladesh has struggled for consistency in the tournament and they gave up without much fight against Sri Lanka and Pakistan. They looked sensational against Afghanistan but there are no guarantees which side will turn up on the given day. Colombo Weather Update: Bright and Sunny, Sri Lanka vs Bangladesh Asia Cup 2023 Super Four Match Expected to Start on Time . Dasun Shanaka is in need of some runs for Sri Lanka given his average has been consistently poor. Though his leadership skills have been exemplary, he would look to put up a show with the bat. Matheesha Pathirana and Maheesh Theekshana are leading the bowling unit for the team. Dimuth Karunaratne and Kusal Mendis can help the team score quickly in the middle phase of the innings which is vital. Bangladesh has issues with their batting with the side failing to get past 200 against both Sri Lanka and Pakistan. Mushfiqur Rahim and Shakib Al Hasan got crucial fifties in the last match but it proved to be futile in the end. The top order will have to find a way to spend some time in the middle. Taskin Ahmed and Shoriful Islam have been decent with the pace attack but need their batters to put a decent total on the board to defend. When is Sri Lanka vs Bangladesh, Asia Cup 2023 Match?

‘Workload Is Twice or Thrice As Much as Anybody Else’s’ Says Hardik Pandya Ahead of IND vs PAK Asia Cup 2023 Super Four Match,"Ahead of India’s Super Four match against Pakistan in the Asia Cup, all-rounder and vice-captain Hardik Pandya shed light on the unique challenges and mindset of an all-rounder, saying his workload in a match is twice or thrice more than anybody else’s. After the 2019 ODI World Cup ended in England, Pandya underwent a major back surgery, which limited his all-round performing abilities. But a change in lifestyle and fitness approach has resulted in him being back to his best and being a reliable all-rounder for the side ahead of 2023 Men’s ODI World Cup in India. India Likely Playing XI vs Pakistan in Asia Cup 2023 Super Four: KL Rahul to Make Comeback? Check Predicted Indian 11 for Cricket Match in Colombo . ""As an all-rounder, my workload is twice or thrice as anyone else. When a batter in the team goes and bats and finishes his batting and is heading home, I’ll still be bowling after that. So for me, all the managing, all the pushing, and everything happens during the sessions or my training or my pre-camp season,” said Pandya to Star Sports. On match days, Pandya sees his role gets adjusted as per the conditions and requirements in a particular situation and backs himself to get the job done. “When the game arrives, it is more about whatever the team requires, and the managing side goes out of the park, and it is more practical calls that how many overs are needed for me. Because if 10 overs are not needed, there is no point in me bowling 10 overs, but if 10 overs are needed, then I’ll be bowling.” “I always believed that I give myself a chance to succeed, which is by reading the game, which is by backing myself because I have always believed that when we go as a believer, when I'm standing there, yes, my ten players, my ten brothers are around me, but at the same point of time I’m alone.” He further elaborated, “When bowling, I have to back myself to the fullest because the opposition, the batter, they want me to make a mistake. At the same point of time, as a batter, yes, two people are batting, he is there with me fighting, but there are also eleven on the ground against me, and at the same point of time, it could be the crowd or anything.” ‘Recent Sri Lankan Experience Gives Pakistan an Edge Over India’ Says Babar Azam Ahead of IND vs PAK Asia Cup 2023 Super Four Match . “So what I have realised is that no matter what happens, you have to back yourself, you have to believe that you are the best in the world. That does not guarantee you success, but at the same point of time, it does give you and it does guide you to work towards success, so practically back yourself.""

SCOOP: Director confirms Ujjwal Nikam biopic with Aamir Khan,"Pre-eminent public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam may soon see himself on screen with Aamir Khan playing him. The project, which was being talked about for some time, has now been confirmed to this writer by cinematographer-director Avinash Arun, who had earlier directed the award-winning Marathi film Killa . SCOOP: Director confirms Ujjwal Nikam biopic with Aamir Khan Confirming his project with Aamir Khan, Avinash Arun said, “Yes, we are in talks.” Further probing revealed that Aamir Khan is not convinced that he is the right fit for the role and would rather produce the Ujjwal Nikam biopic.

‘India Need To Prepare for Good Length Deliveries From Shaheen Shah Afridi’ Says Sanjay Manjrekar Ahead of IND vs PAK Asia Cup 2023 Super Four Match,"With India-Pakistan Asia Cup Super Four clash happening in Colombo on Sunday, focus will be on how the Indian batters will counter Pakistan’s pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi. Afridi emerged as the stand-out bowler for Pakistan by taking 4-35 in skittling India for 266 in the Asia Cup Group A match at Pallekele last week. Former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar spoke on how the Indian top order should prepare themselves to face Afridi in the upcoming highly-anticipated clash. ‘Recent Sri Lankan Experience Gives Pakistan an Edge Over India’ Says Babar Azam Ahead of IND vs PAK Asia Cup 2023 Super Four Match . ""Actually, the match between India and Pakistan was a very interesting clash between Shaheen Afridi versus India’s 1, 2, and 3. Gill, Rohit, and Virat. The opening phase had two spells; in the first spell before the rain had come, he was bowling typical Shaheen Afridi kind of deliveries. He was bowling further up the pitch, trying to get the ball to swing inwards, and that length was being played very well by Shubman Gill and Rohit Sharma,"" said Manjrekar to Star Sports. Though he tested openers Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill, Shaheen got success after the first rain interruption in India’s innings. Shaheen found some movement to beat Rohit twice and finally got his man when the left-arm pacer got one to nip back in and hit the top of the right-handed batter’s off-stump through the gate. In his next over, Shaheen cramped Virat Kohli for room on an attempted punch, to which the right-handed batter could only chop on to his stumps. It also made Shaheen the first bowler in international cricket to get Rohit and Kohli out via “bowled” mode of dismissal in a ODI match in his electrifying opening spell. ""Shaheen Afridi, instead of bowling it up further, which he thought was his main weapon – to bring the ball up further and have it swing, was being played very well by the Indian team and the Indian openers. After that, the rain happened, and Waqar Younis, who was in commentary with me, said that he should pull his length a bit back; it should be a little short."" ""And after the rain, someone must have spoken to Shaheen Afridi, and after the break, he brought his length back and in that length, the good length, Rohit Sharma got out, and so did Virat. So it wasn’t the typical Shaheen Afridi kind of delivery that troubled the Indian batters, but the shorter length, meaning the movement from the pitch made them out,"" added Manjrekar. In the last ten overs of the innings, Shaheen would take out Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja in the same over to lead a late Pakistan fightback and limit India to 266. ""So they need to prepare for these kinds of deliveries as well, but for the main swinging delivery of Shaheen Afridi, the good news was that both Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill weren’t phased by that,"" stated Manjrekar. He also praised Ishan Kishan and Hardik Pandya for leading India’s fightback in the match. After scoring a majestic 210 against Bangladesh while opening the batting at Chattogram last year, Kishan showed a versatile side of him by making a sensible 82 at number five against Pakistan. India were reduced to 66-4, before Kishan and Pandya, who made 87, stepped up in a pressure situation to stitch an important 138-run partnership. ""See the match that happened between India and Pakistan, there was no result to the match, but it was a great result for India, and the main result which India wanted was that contribution from Hardik Pandya, the runs, and Ishan Kishan also played well. And the two of them played so well because it was out of character. Both Ishan Kishan and Hardik Pandya."" ""And the talk about Hardik is that he is a very aggressive player, whenever he wants he can hit massive sixes, but for almost 70 minutes, Hardik Pandya was only taking singles and building his innings because he had to play conservatively. 50 overs cricket is a game of singles, especially the middle phase, it is a very boring phase for both the crowd and the players."" India Likely Playing XI vs Pakistan in Asia Cup 2023 Super Four: KL Rahul to Make Comeback? Check Predicted Indian 11 for Cricket Match in Colombo . ""But both Hardik Pandya and Ishan Kishan played that boring phase, played their innings well, and brought India to a respectable position. So that was a very good result for India, that partnership and how they forgot their natural game and kept the team's needs ahead of that. I think that was the best finding from that match,"" concluded Manjrekar. (The above story first appeared on LatestLY on Sep 09, 2023 01:54 PM IST.

‘Recent Sri Lankan Experience Gives Pakistan an Edge Over India’ Says Babar Azam Ahead of IND vs PAK Asia Cup 2023 Super Four Match,"Pakistan skipper Babar Azam on Saturday said the recent experience of playing in Sri Lankan conditions will give his side an edge over India in Sunday's Asia Cup Super 4 clash. Several Pakistan players have been playing in Sri Lanka since the Test series in July, followed by the Lanka Premier League and the bilateral ODIs against Afghanistan. IND vs PAK Asia Cup 2023 Super Four Preview: Likely Playing XIs, Key Battles, Head-to-Head and More You Need to Know About India vs Pakistan Cricket Match in Colombo . “Given the continuous cricket we are playing both in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, you can say that we hold an edge (over India),"" said Babar in the pre-match press conference. “We have been playing here in Sri Lanka for the past two months or so. We have played Tests, we played a series against Afghanistan and then the LPL... So it can be said that we have an advantage.” Babar's side had to shuttle between Sri Lanka and Pakistan because of the tournament scheduling, but the right-handed batter did not read too much into it. “We always knew the schedule and how much we have to travel. So, it's become important how we look after our players. We have planned everything well,” he said. Pakistan pacers have been doing exceedingly well in the Asia Cup as Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haris Rauf and Naseem Shah have so far taken 23 wickets among them from just three matches. However, Babar exhorted his spinners to join the party in the middle overs so that the pressure applied on opponents does not slip. “Yes, we get a good start (with the ball) and the plan always is to bowl good in middle overs. The effort is to have an effective combination. We need wickets in the middle overs but we are not getting them. “But you can see that we are finishing good. Our pacers are doing well at the end. This is a team performance. If someone fails, then another bowler chips in,” said Babar. This is the second time India and Pakistan are meeting each other in the tournament after their league match at Pallekele ended in a washout. Babar hoped the weather would stay clear on Sunday. Virat Kohli Gifted Silver Bat by Budding Cricketers From Sri Lanka Ahead of IND vs PAK Asia Cup 2023 Super Four Match . “We are focusing on what is in our control. The way the sun is beaming, I don't think it will rain a lot (tomorrow). We are trying to do as much practice as we can,” he added.

"With sexism in Spanish football being scrutinized, female players strike for higher league wages","First, Spain’s Women’s World Cup winners said they would no longer play for their country as they fight sexism in the nation’s football federation. Now, Spain’s women’s league players are on strike and calling for what they call a dignified minimum wage. The Liga F — Spain’s women’s league — was supposed to kick off its second season on Friday, but instead its players are striking for the first two rounds of games. The strike comes with the nation immersed in the scandal caused by football federation president Luis Rubiales when he kissed a Spain player on the lips without her consent during the August 20 awards ceremony in Sydney, Australia after Spain had beaten England in the final. Rubiales’ conduct caused outrage in Spain. It also has drawn attention away from the greatest achievement in the history of Spanish women’s football, which has undergone spectacular growth over the last decade but still is fighting for a pay raise that, if granted, would still be just a fraction of what’s paid in the men’s La Liga. The minimum salary for the women’s league is 16,000 euros ($17,400) before taxes, compared to the 182,000 euros ($197,000) guaranteed for men in La Liga. Of 334 female players, 80 players made under 20,000 ($21,400) euros a year, while the average salary was around 40,000 euros ($42,800), according to the league. For Keka Vega, a former player representing the AFE player’s union, the widespread condemnation of Rubiales in Spain — and abroad — has provided an ideal scenario for players’ quest for a fairer shake. “Our players consider that after the Women’s World Cup title and the worldwide attention that women’s football has received it was a good moment to stand up, fight for their workers’ rights, and demand that the sport received the support it needs to truly develop,” Vega told The Associated Press. “Maybe the league does not consider this to be the best timing, but the players have considered that it was key.” Liga F started as Spain’s first fully professional women’s league last season. Its executives are now concerned that the strike could end up tarnishing its image and lead to fans, and potential sponsors, associating the labor dispute with the Rubiales controversy. Liga F chief executive Pedro Vilches said that strike will hurt the league just when it should be taking advantage of the increased interest in women’s football. To start with, missing the first two rounds will cost clubs between 800,000 to 1 million euros ($857,00-$1 million), he said. “Winning the Women’s World Cup was an extraordinary success, which unfortunately practically nobody is talking about in Spain or the rest of the world because we are only talking about the situation of Luis Rubiales,” Vilches told the AP. “And it is true that all the focus is on the Liga F, but we have been honest and offered the maximum that we can.” Vilches said that Spanish and international companies which have shown interest in becoming new sponsors of the league are concerned with the turmoil caused by Rubiales. And he fears that could be compounded by the strike. “There are companies . . . that have become hesitant in negotiations because they don’t want to associated with this type of scandal,” Vilches said. “And the strike does not help.” The league, led by former player and president Beatriz Álvarez, immediately demanded the resignation of Rubiales for his conduct at the Women’s World Cup final, when he also grabbed his crotch in a lewd victory gesture. “We were one of the first (sports bodies) to denounce (Rubiales), and our president has backed that up by speaking out as a question of her convictions,” Vilches said. “We are a women’s league . . . and of course we don’t want to look the other way.” The creation of a women’s league independent from the federation was a landmark moment for women’s sports in the football-crazed country. That struggle has included other gains such as having games televised, more attention from the local sports media, and the all-powerful Real Madrid finally fielding a women’s team in 2020. Vilches argued that only Barcelona, which has won the last four domestic titles, two of the last three Champions Leagues, and has two-time Ballon d’Or winner Alexia Putellas, has a women’s team that is economically sustainable. He said the rest are losing money for their clubs despite the growth in revenues, which reached 6 million euros ($6.4 million) for the league last season. The league said that its four clubs that only field women’s teams, and thus have no men’s team to also bring in money, also depend on government support. Vilches also said that the league estimates that any increase to the minimum wage would lead to increases up the pay scale. But Vega, the players’ union representative, said that the unions were convinced that the clubs pay higher salaries given the extra revenues sure to come. In addition to typical living expense, she said: “You have to eat well, you have to carry out specific medical treatments if you are injured, and do all that on 16,000 euros.” Rubiales, who was already temporarily suspended by FIFA, was formally accused by Spanish state prosecutors of sexual assault and coercion on Friday. Now his fate is in the hands of a judge, who will decide whether the case should be investigated or shelved. Spain’s national team players have said they won’t play again for their country “if the present leadership remains in charge.” They have yet to say if they will return after Rubiales was suspended and their unpopular coach was fired last week. Spain is scheduled to start the Women’s Nations League on September 22. Comments Related Topics",sports
Our goal is to leave China with no regrets: India hockey forward Abhishek,"Abhishek began his hockey career on a grass pitch under the tutelage of a Hindi teacher, and his selection to the Indian men’s hockey team for the 19th Asian Games Hangzhou 2022 is a testament to his dedication. “I am ecstatic to have been named to the squad, and I am eager to give my all on the pitch.

He has scored 18 goals in 48 appearances, so far. “I played on grass for the first ten years of my career, and the first time I played on turf was when I transferred to the National Hockey Academy (NHA) for a couple of years. That period of my career was memorable; I competed in the U-18 Asia Cup from the National Hockey Academy and made the Junior Indian Men’s Hockey Team in 2017. After that, I joined the Punjab National Bank Hockey Team in 2018 and played there for three years before making it to the Indian Men’s Hockey Team based on my performance in the 1st Hockey India Senior Men Inter-Department National Championship 2021 in Bangalore,” Abhishek said. Abhishek made his debut in the 2021-22 FIH Hockey Pro League and went on to make a name for himself on the big stage, winning two Players of the Match awards during the FIH Odisha Hockey Men’s World Cup 2023 Bhubaneswar - Rourkela. When asked about his team’s preparations for the 19th Asian Games Hangzhou 2022, Abhishek stated, “We will face some good teams, and we are working very hard in training to make sure we are in the best physical and mental shape when we step onto the pitch.” India is placed in Pool A of the 9th Asian Games Hangzhou 2022, along with Pakistan, Japan, Bangladesh, Singapore, and Uzbekistan. “My teammates and coaches are all eager to help me; they encourage me and support me in moving forward quickly if I make any mistakes in training. I often turn to Mandeep and Lalit for support if I have any concerns about the structure; they are always willing to talk on and off the pitch,” Abhishek explained about the team’s camaraderie.

Australia adds Neser to bolster pace attack in South Africa,"Queenslander Michael Neser will return to the country of his birth to shore up Australia’s pace attack in the ongoing one day international series in South Africa, after more injuries hit the team. “Ness is an experienced all-format cricketer who will provide us with an extra fast bowling option should that be required for the remainder of the tour,” selector Tony Dodemaide said ahead of the second ODI at Bloemfontein later on Saturday. Pretoria-born right-arm pacer Neser, who has played two Tests and as many ODIs for Australia, will join the team in Potchefstroom ahead of the third match. Captain Pat Cummins (wrist) and fellow paceman Mitchell Starc (groin) are recovering from injuries. Left hand quick Spencer Johnson, who was added to the ODI squad, has now sustained a hamstring injury, Cricket Australia (CA) said on Saturday. All-rounder Cameron Green suffered concussion during the opening ODI, which Australia won by three wickets to grab a 1-0 lead in the five-match series. Johnson will remain in South Africa and travel with rest of the white-ball squad to India later this month, added the CA statement. Comments Related Topics",sports
"In ‘GUTS,’ Olivia Rodrigo rages against the machine and bad men with humour","On Friday, Olivia Rodrigo — the Grammy winner best known for her 2021 smash single “drivers license” — released her highly anticipated sophomore album, “GUTS.” It's an apt title, because audacious she is: Across 12 tracks, Rodrigo builds off the life experiences of a pop superstar now in the throes of fame — and her early 20s — with an acute wisdom. From the bloodsucking piano ballad “vampire” to the cheeky backslide anthem “bad idea right?” (Rodrigo has kept the all-lowercase titles that styled her debut), “GUTS” is at times a pop-punk album unafraid of taking dynamic swings, and a diaristic bloodletting. But those lead singles hid greater moments: opener “all-american bitch,” inspired by a cast-off quote from a young hippie in Joan Didion's “The White Album” essay collection, is pop-punk informed by Liz Phair or, like, the most obscure Rose Melberg record. Irony and anger are her swords: “I’m grateful all the time / I’m sexy and I’m kind / I’m pretty when I cry,” she sings. “pretty isn't pretty” recalls The Cure's dreamy guitar tones, a cutting treatise on the price of impossible beauty standards. It's easy to hear your favorite rock bands represented here, but in a style completely Rodrigo's own: Pavement punctuates “ballad of a homeschooled girl,” with lyrics that could double as a AOL away message. Pick your favorite: “S?archin’ ‘how to start a conversation?’ on a website (How to flirt?)”, or “Thought your mom was your wife / Called you the wrong name twice / Can’t think of a third line.” “the grudge” is born from “drivers license” — a courageous piano power ballad. Where whisper-singing has become the foundation for many contemporary young pop stars, whose biggest singles consequently feel restrained, Rodrigo's performance is pushed to the limits. Rage and disappointment will do that to you: They're perhaps pop's most underutilized tools — and rock's greatest asset. At the top of her debut album, Rodrigo asked “I’m so sick of 17 / Where’s my f—-ing teenage dream?” in “brutal.” On “GUTS” she answers it in the closer “teenage dream”: “I’m sorry that I couldn’t always be your teenage dream,” she sings, the same woman who made getting her driver's license a pop music concern for the world. Could adolescence be more damning? Long has Rodrigo has been compared to her musical antecedent Taylor Swift, but the points of evidence on “GUTS” are few and far between — and in the album's weakest moments, like “get him back!”, still far superior to a lesser artist's greatest uptempo track. (Special mention goes to the lyric “I wanna meet your mom, just to tell her her son sucks."" Has devastation ever been so funny?) “For me, this album is about growing pains and trying to figure out who I am at this point in my life,” Rodrigo said in a press release when the album was first announced. “I feel like I grew 10 years between the ages of 18 and 20 — it was such an intense period of awkwardness and change. I think that’s all just a natural part of growth, and hopefully the album reflects that.” The musician once again teamed up with her close collaborator Dan Nigro, who produced ""SOUR,” her first album that was a multiplatinum debut that won Rodrigo three Grammy Awards and made her the youngest solo artist ever to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Few forces are more potent than a young creative woman's dissatisfaction — only, of course, if she chooses to wield it. For Rodrigo, it was never a question. She'll just punctuate it with a laugh.",entertainment

"Madhuri Dixit was asked to remove blouse, shoot in bra for Amitabh Bachchan film","Tribune Web Desk Chandigarh, September 9 Actor-director Tinu Anand had already given hit films with Amitabh Bachchan, including 'Kaalia' and 'Shahenshah'. In 1989, he had signed Big B and Madhuri Dixit for a film titled 'Shanakht'. Narrating an incident from the film, Tinu, in a recent interaction, said he had an argument with Madhuri over her costume on the very first day of the shoot. Things got so heated up that he almost fired her from the film. In an interview with Radio Nasha, Tinu explained the scene where Amitabh was tied up in chains by the villain. “He is trying to protect Madhuri but gets overpowered by the goons. So Madhuri’s character says why are you attacking a man in chains when a woman is standing in front of you,” Tinu recalls. Tinu then claimed that he had narrated the entire scene to Madhuri before she signed the movie. He recounts telling her that she would have to unbutton her blouse and stand in a bra while Amitabh would be chained to a carriage. “I told her that you have to remove your blouse and for the first time, we should see you in your bra. And I am not going to hide anything behind a haystack or anything. Because you are offering yourself to help a man who is trying to help you. So it is a very important situation and I want to shoot it on the first day. She said okay,” the actor-director recounts. Tinu said he asked Madhuri to design her own bra for the scene, but it had to be a bra and no other clothing. Talking about the day of shoot, Tinu said he waited for Madhuri Dixit to come on the set and when even after 45 minutes she did not come out of her room, he went in to check if everything was fine. Madhuri, on the other hand, hadn’t even started getting ready for the scene. At the time for the shoot, Tinu said Madhuri refused to do the scene. “I asked what happened. She said, ‘Tinu, I don’t want to do this particular scene.’ I said, ‘I’m sorry, you have to do this scene.’ She said, ‘No, I don’t want to.’ I said, ‘Okay, pack up, say good bye to the film. I’ll cancel my shoot.” Later, Amitabh intervened to pacify the situation. Tinu recalls what Big B said, “He said, ‘Let it be, why are you arguing with her? If she has an objection…’ I said, ‘If she had to object, she should have done it earlier, before signing the film,’” he said. However, Madhuri’s secretary came in and assured Tinu that she would do the scene. #Amitabh Bachchan",entertainment

Attacking Sanatan Dharma Has Become 'Fashion' for 'Frustrated Fraternity': Naqvi,"Hitting out at DMK leaders’ remarks on Sanatan Dharma, senior BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Saturday said that attacking the ‘Sanatan Dharma’ has become a “fashion"" for the “frustrated fraternity"" but their “bankruptcy will backfire"". Participating in the BJP’s nationwide ‘Meri Maati, Mera Desh’ campaign in Rampur, Naqvi said ‘Sanatan Dharma’ is the soul of Bharat and those who are trying to attack that soul, will be destroyed. “If someone attacks the Sanatan Dharma, the oldest faith on Earth, it reflects their mental illness,"" Naqvi was quoted as saying in a statement from his office. Attacking the ‘Sanatan Dharma’ has become a “fashion"" for the “frustrated fraternity"" but the “blasphemous bankruptcy"" of the “Sanatan bashing brigade"" will backfire, the former Union minister said. Naqvi said Bharat has witnessed hundreds of foreign invasions which not only looted resources but also attacked “Sanatan values and Bharatiya culture"" and identity. The foreign invaders succeeded in looting the immense resources of Bharat but could not succeed in their “nefarious"" designs to destroy the culture and Sanatan values of this great country, he said. Naqvi said the ongoing “communal and criminal attack"" on the Sanatan culture is “not by chance, but by choice"". “It’s our national duty to work together to defeat any such intentional and deliberate designs against Bharatiya culture and values,"" he added. Naqvi also hit out at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his remarks abroad, saying that while the entire world is lauding Bharat, the Congress and its former chief have become “merchants of misinformation"" and “contractors of conspiracies"" against the country on foreign soil. Naqvi’s remarks come amid a political row after DMK leader Udhayanidhi Stalin blamed Sanatan Dharma for promoting division and discrimination among people and said it should be eradicated. Also, DMK leader A Raja likened it to diseases like leprosy and HIV which had social stigma, prompting the BJP to accuse opposition leaders of suffering from “deep-rooted Hinduphobia"".",politics
Sacked Rajasthan Minister Rajendra Singh Gudha Joins Shiv Sena,"Sacked Rajasthan minister and BSP-turned-Congress MLA Rajendra Singh Gudha has joined Shiv Sena, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde announced on Saturday. Addressing a gathering in Gudha’s assembly constituency, Udaipurwati, in Jhunjhunu district, Shinde welcomed the former Rajasthan minister to the Shiv Sena and said Gudha left the ministerial position for the cause of people. “Gudha has come to Shiv Sena. I welcome him to Shiv Sena family, Shinde said. Shinde said that Gudha spoke about the safety of women and law and order and he was removed for it. What wrong did he say?"" the Maharashtra chief minister said. Gudha, who was the minister of state for panchayati raj and rural development, was dismissed from the post in July after he cornered the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government in the state assembly drawing parallels between sexual violence in strife-hit Manipur and crimes against women in Rajasthan. Following his termination, Gudha claimed he had a ‘red diary’ that contained details of alleged illegal transactions by Gehlot. Shinde said that Rajasthan needs improved law and order, safety of women, job opportunities for youths and progress of farmers. The Maharashtra chief minister said that Rajasthan requires industries and there is huge potential in sectors such as mining which can be used to create job opportunities for local youths so that they are not forced to migrate to other states in search of jobs. Gudha gave up the ministerial post “for truth"" and therefore he has joined Shiv Sena, Shinde said. On the possibility of an alliance with the BJP in Rajasthan, Shinde said Shiv Sena will only engage with the “politics of development"" for elections and added that decisions on it will be taken when polls are closer. Rajendra Gudha contested the 2018 assembly elections on a BSP ticket and joined Congress along with five other BSP MLAs. BSP had won six seats in the last assembly elections and all the MLAs had joined the ruling party.",politics

Instead, Apple may launch the Ultra line as separate line of iPhones in 2024 Mehul Reuben Das Last Updated:September 09, 2023 16:48:39 IST Apple is not going to launch the iPhone 15 Ultra or iPhone Ultra this year at the Apple Wanderlust 2023 event. Instead, Apple may launch the Ultra line as separate line of iPhones in 2024 Despite earlier speculation that this year’s premium iPhone model might adopt the name “iPhone 15 Ultra,” it appears that Apple will not be going in that direction. According to a recent report outlining expectations for the upcoming “Wonderlust” event, Bloomberg has revealed that Apple intends to retain the “Pro Max” branding for this year’s top-tier iPhone, naming it the “iPhone 15 Pro Max.” There has been considerable speculation about whether Apple would introduce the “Ultra” brand, particularly in light of the Apple Watch Ultra from last year. However, it now appears that these discussions were ultimately inconclusive. Related Articles Apple will unveil the iPhone 15 series on Sept 12, but here’s when people can actually buy them Apple Wonderlust Event: iPhone 15 series to be launched on September 12, here’s what to expect Mark Gurman of Bloomberg, in addition to sharing insights into the battery life and camera specifications of the iPhone 15, as well as the prospect of USB-C AirPods, has confirmed the nomenclature for the high-end iPhone this year as the “iPhone 15 Pro Max.” In accordance with its established practice in recent years, Apple is set to introduce four distinct models in its upcoming iPhone 15 lineup. These models will include the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and the highest-tier variant, which will be referred to as the iPhone 15 Pro Max. There won’t be an iPhone 15 Ultra in 2023. In all likelihood, Apple won’t be launching the Ultra in their regular series, and may instead opt to release it as a standalone series, like it did with the Watch Ultra. Whatever the case may be the iPhone Ultra is likely to be launched in 2024. The standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will serve as the base models, featuring aluminium sides and a glass back, much like their predecessors, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The two top-tier iPhone models will undergo a significant design change. They will be moving on from stainless steel frames to a titanium build, marking a notable shift in materials used for the premium variants. This change in construction materials is expected to contribute to a fresh and distinctive look for the high-end iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max models.

It is basically a camera that can see in absolute darkness. It recently took a picture of Chandrayaan 3's Vikram Lander Mehul Reuben Das Last Updated:September 09, 2023 15:44:48 IST The Chandrayaan 2 orbiter has one of the most sophisticated instruments of any space mission, the Dual-frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar or DFSAR. It is basically a camera that can see in absolute darkness. It recently took a picture of Chandrayaan 3's Vikram Lander Chandrayaan 3’s Vikram Lander and Pragyan Rover had been hard at work for 14 days straight on the moon, after which, both of these modules were put to sleep during the long and cold lunar night. ISRO has shared a photo of the Vikram Lander Module enjoying its period of rest. The cool thing about the photos that ISRO shared was they it was taken by Chandrayaan 2’s Lunar Orbiter. Chandrayaan-3 Mission: Here is an image of the Chandrayaan-3 Lander taken by the Dual-frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar (DFSAR) instrument onboard the Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter on September 6, 2023. More about the instrument: https://t.co/TrQU5V6NOq pic.twitter.com/ofMjCYQeso Related Articles JACKPOT: Pragyan rover finds Oxygen, Titanium, Silicon and Sulphur on Moon’s south pole. Here’s why it is important Say Cheese! Pragyan Rover shares first photos of Vikram Lander toiling on Moon surface — ISRO (@isro) September 9, 2023 The Chandrayaan 3 mission’s Vikram lander, which recently entered sleep mode, has been captured in an image taken by the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter. In the photograph, the lander can be observed positioned on the lunar surface, near the Moon’s South Pole, as it awaits the arrival of sunlight. The image of the Chandrayaan 3’s lander, which was shared by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), was captured using the Dual-frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar (DFSAR) instrument onboard the Chandrayaan 2 Orbiter. This instrument played a pivotal role in capturing the image of the lander on Wednesday, providing valuable visual data for the ongoing efforts to assess and potentially reactivate the Vikram lander as part of the Chandrayaan 3 mission. SAR, ISRO explains in a note attached to the post, is an instrument that transmits microwaves in a specific frequency band and receives the same, reflected off of a surface. In very rudimentary terms, think of it like SONAR or RADAR, but instead of sound or radiowaves, the instrument uses microwaves. SAR enables imaging without the need for any illumination, making it highly useful for remote sensing applications on Earth and other celestial bodies. Moreover, it can “see” beyond the surface as well. ISRO’s DFSAR, a crucial scientific instrument onboard the Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter, operates using microwaves in the L- and S-band frequency ranges. It stands out as a state-of-the-art instrument, providing the highest resolution polarimetric images currently available on any planetary mission. The longer radar wavelength used by DFSAR enables it to explore subsurface features on the lunar surface down to depths of a few meters. Over the past four years, DFSAR has been consistently delivering high-quality data by capturing images of the lunar surface. Its primary focus has been on lunar polar science, contributing valuable insights into this region of the Moon. As for the Vikram Lander and the Pragyan Rover on the Moon ISRO expects that once sunlight returns to the area, the two can be reactivated. ISRO has stated that although the chances of the Rover coming back to life may be extremely low, it had its batteries completely juiced up when it was sent to sleep. ISRO is pretty confident that the Vikram lander can be reactivated, provided it has endured the harsh cold conditions on the Moon. This development underscores the continued efforts to re-establish communication and functionality with the Vikram lander as part of the Chandrayaan 3 mission.

Income Tax dept slaps notices on start-ups seeking creditworthiness of investors,"PTI New Delhi, September 9 The Income Tax Department has slapped notices on some startups seeking information on creditworthiness of their investors as it looked to verify if the amount invested was commensurate with the income declared by the investors. The tax department replying to a social media post of BharatPe co-founder and former MD Ashneer Grover, said under the law, the onus was on the assessee-company to provide the identity and creditworthiness of the investors as well as the genuineness of the transaction. “In the last one month, a number of startups (a few in my portfolio as well) have received Income Tax notices asking to furnish information about shareholders,” Grover had said on a post on X, formerly Twitter, on September 8. “Bahut interesting hai (it is very interesting) - they are asking start-up companies to furnish a 3 year ITR [income tax return] of all shareholders.” He went on to ask how and why the startup would have ITR of shareholders. “Why would a shareholder/individual share their ITR with a private company?” He went on to state that the reason given is to ‘to establish creditworthiness of shareholders’. “Why,” he asked. Company shareholders aren’t given loans and instead are putting equity in the firm, he added, asking the Union Ministry of Finance to look into this. Replying to him, the Income Tax Department in a post on X said, “Section 68 of Income-tax Act, 1961 (the Act) under which the Assessing Officer (AO) has made the enquiry about creditworthiness of the shareholder/investor, places initial onus on the assessee-company to prove the following: a) Identity of the investor, b) Creditworthiness of the investor and c) Genuineness of the transaction.” It went on to state that the “Finance Act, 2012 mandated that the nature and source of any sum credited as share capital, share premium etc., in the books of a closely-held company (excluding Venture Capital Fund or a Venture Capital Company registered with SEBI) shall be treated as explained u/s 68 only if the source of funds from a resident shareholder is also explained by investor.” On the cases raised by Grover, it said: “In the present case, it appears that the AO has sought to examine the genuineness of the transaction and source of investment by the shareholder-investor, to verify if the amount invested is commensurate with the income shown in the ITRs of the investors.” Alternatively, it sought income tax permanent account numbers or PAN of the investors be shared so that the income tax returns of the investors can be verified. “This has been the practice,” it added. Infosys co-founder and investor Mohandas Pai jumped in to say that this was “misleading”. He first tagged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) on Grover’s initial post to say, “sir tax terrorism is increasing! This is against what you have stood for. Please intervene.” That post he tagged a host of politicians and ministers including BJP Yuva Morcha national president and MP Tejasvi Surya and BJP’s Bengaluru Central MP P C Mohan. After, Income Tax Department clarified the position clearing stating that the alternative to furnishing three years of income tax return is to furnish PAN of the investors, he posted again. “Again this is misleading,” he said, tagging the Union Ministry of Finance, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. “Asking for the PAN is the law. But how can you also ask for 3 year tax returns of the investor from the start up? Does the law permit this. @IncomeTaxIndia itself says that Pan is sufficient. Why this overreach?,” he asked. Grover reposted Pai’s post on X. #Social Media",business

"Faruk Fatih Ozer Jailed for 11,196 Years: Turkish Cryptocurrency Boss Sentenced to Prison for Fraud and Money Laundering","Mumbai, September 9: The tainted Turkish cryptocurrency founder, along with his two brothers, has been sentenced to an astounding 11,196 years in prison each. Faruk Fatih Ozer, the former head of Thodex, who had fled to Albania, faced charges of money laundering, fraud, and establishing a criminal organisation. Prosecutors had initially sought a staggering 40,562-year prison sentence for Ozer, reported the Anadolu state news agency reported on Friday. According to Turkish media reports, his two brothers, Serap and Guven, were also handed the same lengthy prison sentence following a brief trial, with the verdict being delivered late on Thursday. Turkey has gained notoriety for imposing substantial prison terms, a trend that became more prevalent after the country abolished the death penalty in 2004 as part of its efforts to align with European Union requirements. US Securities and Exchange Commission Sues Eight Celebrities, Including Lindsay Lohan, for Crypto Fraud via Market Manipulation . In April 2021, there were reports that Ozer left Turkey, claiming to have taken $2 billion of investors' money with him. However, this amount has been questioned since then. According to prosecutors, when Ozer left Turkey in April 2021, he moved around 250 million Turkish liras (about $30 million at that time) from user accounts to three hidden accounts. A significant portion of this money ended up in a bank in Malta. The indictment stated that the Ozer brothers caused a total of 356 million Turkish liras in losses to their clients. ChatGPT-Like AI Chat Tool Used by CryptoRom Scammers To Trick Users Into Scams, Says Report . ""If I were to establish a criminal organisation, I would not have acted so amateurishly,"" Anadolu quoted Ozer as telling the court. The case made headlines because it coincided with a period of significant growth in the Turkish cryptocurrency market. However, this growth has since slowed down primarily due to increased government regulations. The indictment stated that the Ozer brothers were responsible for causing 356 million Turkish liras in losses to their clients.

India vs Pakistan Asia Cup Super 4 Match: Who Has The Edge?,"The most-awaited moment is almost here as the Asia Cup 2023 Super Four match between India and Pakistan will be played on Sunday in Colombo. All the fans were left heartbroken after the group stage match between the arch-rivals got washed out due to heavy rainfall in Kandy. Since then, the Rohit Sharma -led side has faced Nepal and defeated them by 10 wickets. On the other hand, the Babar Azam -led side went against Bangladesh in their first Super Four match and defeated them by seven wickets. As both the teams will now be squaring off against each other once again, let's see that which team has got an upper hand over the other: Head to Head India and Pakistan have faced each other 133 times in the 50-over format. Out of those matches, Pakistan have won 73 while India have won 55. Top Performances Pakistan's most prolific batter in the ongoing Asia Cup in Fakhar Zaman with a total of 207 runs. While for India, this position is held by skipper Rohit Sharma, who has smashed a whopping total of 731 runs. In terms of individual scores, Zaman once again stands out for Pakistan with his knock of 114 against India during the Champions Trophy final in 2017. On the other hand, Virat Kohli holds the position for India with his magnificent knock of 183 against Pakistan in 2012. In bowling, Shadab Khan has scalped four wickets while all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja has got 10 wickets. Pacer Shaheen Afridi has registered the best bowling figures of 4/35 for Pakistan during the group stage match against India in Asia Cup 2023. While for India, Mohammed Shami registered the best figures of 4/35 against Pakistan in 2015. Best win percentage As a team: Pakistan (82%) and India (69%) have the best win percentage in ODIs since 2022. Apart from that, both the teams also have the best win percentage amongst visiting nations in Sri Lanka in ODIs. As a captain: In the ODI format, Babar Azam has got an edge over Rohit Sharma as he has registered 18 wins in 23 matches, since 2022 while India skipper Rohit Sharma has got 13 victories in 19 matches. Indian opening pair Advertisement Indian openers Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill put on a convincing 147 runs opening stand to register a 10 wicket in the last game against Nepal. The duo has started to open the innings for Team India and put on 845 runs in 10 innings which is most by a pair for any wicket in 2023. Apart from this, as an opening pair Rohit and Gill average 93.9 which is the best by an Indian opening pair in a calendar year in ODIs with min. 500 runs. Pakistan's opening pair The opening batters Fakhar Zaman and Imam-ul-Haq have contributed consistently in Pakistan's batting success upfront in ODIs. Both the batters have paired up nearly 2500 runs together – the second most by any opening pair for Pakistan in ODIs. Pace department Rohit and other Indian batters will be wary of the high-paced incoming deliveries of Shaheen Shah Afridi, but the Pakistan bowling unit has other equally explosive performers. Haris Rauf , with his express pace, is currently topping the Asia Cup bowling chart with 9 wickets from three matches, and seemed to have emerged from the shadows of Afridi (7 wickets). While Naseem Shah also has taken 7 wickets, ensuring no let off point for opposition batters. Pakistan has an edge on paper in this department, but India will believe that they have the ammunition to strike back in kind. The return of Jasprit Bumrah , who skipped the league match against Nepal, will bolster India's bowling, while Mohammed Siraj and Shardul Thakur can play the efficient support cast role.

"IND v PAK, Super 4s predicted XIs: Will KL Rahul play on his return from injury?","Listen to Story India will lock horns with Pakistan in their first Super Fours match of Asia Cup 2023 at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Sunday, September 10. After their due to rain in the second half, there is plenty of hype around the big clash in the Super Fours stage. All eyes will be on the weather in Colombo on Sunday as there is prediction for rain, especially in the afternoon. The weather stayed okay for most of the Super Fours contest between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh on Saturday and the fans of India and Pakistan will be hoping for more of the same in the Sri Lankan capital on Sunday. Pakistan continued their practice of on the eve of their Asia Cup matches as they went with the same XI that defeated Bangladesh in Lahore in their Super Fours match earlier in the week. Pakistan backed Faheem Ashraf, the medium-pace all-rounder, ahead of left-arm spinner Mohammad Nawaz. Our playing XI for the match ð??µð??° — Pakistan Cricket (@TheRealPCB) India have a couple of healthy headaches to deal with as Jasprit Bumrah is back from his paternity leave while KL Rahul has linked-up with the squad after missing the group stages. Bumrah missed the game against Nepal and did not get an opportunity to bowl against Pakistan in Pallekele and India will have no second thoughts about putting his name on the team sheet on Sunday. It might not be as straightforward a decision when it comes to KL Rahul's selection. It remains to be seen if the Lucknow Super Giants captain can be included as wicketkeeper-batter, considering the workload on his return from a long injury lay-off. Rahul suffered a groin niggle after recovering from a thigh injury for which he required surgery. However, the team management has backed KL Rahul despite the nagging injury concerns and they might be tempted to give Rahul a game against Pakistan in a high-pressure outing. Will it be Ishan Kishan to make way for KL Rahul? Ishan, who was asked to bat at No. 5 against Pakistan, stepped up and shone with an 81-ball 82 under pressure. India were reduced to 66 for 4 after Shaheen Afridi and Haris Rauf ran through the top-order but Ishan played a counter-punching knock in a 138-run stand with Hardik Pandya that helped India get to 266. Captain Rohit Sharma had hinted about the possibility of playing both Ishan Kishan and KL Rahul but will the team management be brutal enough to drop Shreyas Iyer after just one batting innings on his return from along injury layoff? The three-way battle for No. 4 and No. 5 spots is going to be interesting. As , it might come down to Shreyas Iyer vs KL Rahul for one of the two spots. On the other hand, India will also have to make a call on whether to persist with Shardul Thakur or play Axar Patel in the XI. The Colombo pitch offered something for both spinners and pacers in the game between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh on Saturday. And there was more on offer for spin under lights. Mohammed Shami might as well miss out again as India are looking to play that extra all-rounder to beef up their batting unit. India: Rohit Sharma (captain), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, Ishan Kishan (wk), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Siraj, Jasprit Bumrah.",sports

Sources: Bucs not signing Evans to extension,"MINNEAPOLIS -- The Tampa Bay Buccaneers will not be signing Mike Evans to a contract extension despite the four-time Pro Bowl wide receiver's Saturday deadline, league sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter. No deal was offered in the days since Evans and his agent, Deryk Gilmore, went public with their demands, sources told ESPN. Evans, who turned 30 last month, will play out the 2023 season -- the last in his current contract -- before testing free agency in 2024. The deadline passing is not expected to affect Evans' availability this season. Negotiations between the two parties had carried on for the past two years, with short- and long-term deals proposed to extend Evans' time in Tampa, Florida, beyond 10 years, sources said. In fact, the length of the deal was less important than the guarantees for Evans, who emphasized the word ""secure"" when discussing a new contract Thursday. Sources close to the situation said they believe that this is an ownership call versus a front office call. The Glazer family, who own the Buccaneers, signed off on the franchise borrowing nearly $100 million from the future to support a Tom Brady Super Bowl run for three seasons, which has meant limited resources with the salary cap as they try to rebuild. This doesn't preclude the Buccaneers from attempting to re-sign Evans in March, when he will become an unrestricted free agent, but it has left an impression with the wide receiver, who has said on numerous occasions that he's wanted to be a ""Buc for life"" and has been arguably their most visible player in the community, with three consecutive Walter Payton Man of the Year nominations along with nine straight 1,000-yard seasons.",sports

"'Disrespected' Buffs batter Huskers, move to 2-0","BOULDER, Colo. -- Two games into the Coach Prime era and the bar has already been raised at Colorado. After upsetting national runner-up TCU last week, the No. 22 Buffaloes cruised to a 36-14 win against longtime rival Nebraska in the first regular season home game under coach Deion Sanders. ""We didn't just want to win, we wanted to dominate,"" Sanders said. ""The first half, we weren't dominant, the second half, we got it together and we began to dominate. We wanted to really impose our will."" All week, Sanders preached to him team how the game against the Cornhuskers would be ""personal."" He asked each of them to find a way to make it personal for them and to let that carry into Saturday morning. For Sanders' son, quarterback Shedeur Sanders, the Huskers made it easy. ""It was extremely personal,"" Sanders said. ""We go out there to warm up and you got the head coach for the other team (Matt Rhule) trying to stand in the middle of the Buff. It's OK if a couple of players do it, it's fine. Just enjoy the scenery, but when you've got a whole team trying to disrespect it, I'm not going for that at all, so I went in there and disrupted it. ""The Buff means a lot to me."" Shedeur Sanders also hadn't forgotten about offseason comments from Rhule, he interpreted as disrespectful toward his father. Shortly after being hired, Rhule said in an interview that he doesn't ""let cameras in, there won't be a camera following me around. I want it to always be (about) the players."" This came shortly after Deion Sanders' arrival in Boulder, where cameras seemingly following him everywhere he goes. ""The coach said a lot of things about my pops, about the program, but now that he want to act nice -- I don't respect that because you're hating on another man, you shouldn't do that,"" Shedeur Sanders said. ""It was just, all respect was gone for them and their program. I like playing against their DC, I like playing against them, but the respect level, it ain't there cause you disrespected us first."" After an elusive scramble and a completion on a two-point conversion attempt that would end up overruled on replay, Sanders celebrated by taking his helmet off in the end zone. The decision drew a 15-yard penalty and his father's ire. ""I went over and said, 'You cannot do that. You cannot take your helmet off.' He said, 'Dad, it's personal,'"" Sanders said. ""I was really upset and he broke up the monotony with, 'It's personal.' They really took it to heart, that whole thing."" Colorado started the game slowly, but after Nebraska cut the deficit to 13-7 early in the third quarter, it was all Buffs the rest of the way before a sold-out crowd of 53,241 - the largest at Folsom Field in 15 years. Sanders finished the day 31 of 42 for 393 yards with a pair of touchdowns, including 10 passes to South Florida transfer Xavier Weavers (170 yards, 1 touchdown). ""First of all, a lot of credit to them,"" Rhule said. ""They are well put together, fast, dynamic and explosive. Sean (Lewis) with the offense does a great job and a lot of credit to Coach Sanders and his team. They played well today.""

The space agency's Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network (ISTRAC) carried out the operation. ""The third Earth-bound manoeuvre (EBN#3) is performed successfully from ISTRAC, Bengaluru. ISRO's ground stations at Mauritius, Bengaluru, SDSC-SHAR and Port Blair tracked the satellite during this operation,"" the Indian Space Research Organisation ISRO) said in a post on social media platform X. The new orbit attained is 296 km x 71767 km, it said, adding the next manoeuvre is scheduled on September 15, around 2 am. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); Aditya-L1 is the first Indian space-based observatory that will study the Sun from a halo orbit around the first Sun-Earth Lagrangian point (L1), which is located roughly 1.5 million km from the Earth. The first and second earth-bound manoeuvres were successfully performed on September 3 and 5, respectively. The spacecraft will undergo one more earth-bound orbital manoeuvres before it is placed in the transfer orbit towards the Lagrange point L1. The manoeuvres are required to be performed during the spacecraft's 16-day journey around the earth, during which it will gain the velocity necessary for its onward journey to L1. ISRO's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C57) had on September 2 successfully launched Aditya-L1 from the Second Launch Pad of Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota. The spacecraft is expected to arrive at the intended orbit at the L1 point after about 127 days, the space agency had said soon after the launch. According to ISRO, a spacecraft placed in the halo orbit around the L1 point has the advantage of continuously viewing the Sun without any occultation or eclipses. This will provide a greater advantage of observing solar activities and their effect on space weather in real-time. Aditya-L1 carries seven scientific payloads developed indigenously by the ISRO and national research laboratories, including the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bengaluru, and the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Pune. The payloads will observe the photosphere, chromosphere and the outermost layers of the Sun -- the corona -- using electromagnetic, particle and magnetic field detectors. Using the special vantage point L1, four payloads will directly view the Sun and the remaining three will carry out in-situ studies of particles and fields at the Lagrange point L1, providing important data on the propagatory effect of solar dynamics in the interplanetary medium. The suits of Aditya L1 payloads are expected to provide the most crucial information to understand the problem of coronal heating, coronal mass ejection, pre-flare and flare activities and their characteristics, dynamics of space weather, and propagation of particles and fields. According to scientists, there are five Lagrangian points, or parking areas, between the Earth and the Sun where a small object tends to stay put. The Lagrange Points are named after Italian-French mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange. These points in space can be used by spacecraft to remain there with reduced fuel consumption. At a Lagrange point, the gravitational pull of the two large bodies (the Sun and the Earth) equals the necessary centripetal force required for a small object to move with them.

"Morocco Earthquake Kills Over 2,000, Survivors Rely On ""Nobody But God""","At several places, rescue workers picked through rubble with their bare hands. Moroccan earthquake survivors huddled for a night in the open on the High Atlas Mountains on Saturday, a day after the country's deadliest quake in more than six decades killed more than 2,000 people and laid waste to villages. Neighbours were still searching for survivors buried on the slopes, where houses of mud brick, stone and rough wood were cracked open and mosque minarets toppled by the quake that struck late on Friday. The historic old city of Marrakech also suffered extensive damage. The Interior Ministry said 2,012 people had been killed and 2,059 injured, including 1,404 in critical condition. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake had a magnitude of 6.8 with an epicentre some 72 km (45 miles) southwest of Marrakech. In the village of Amizmiz near the epicentre, rescue workers picked through rubble with their bare hands. Fallen masonry blocked narrow streets. Outside a hospital, around 10 bodies lay covered in blankets as grieving relatives stood nearby. ""When I felt the earth shaking beneath my feet and the house leaning, I rushed to get my kids out. But my neighbours couldn't,"" said Mohamed Azaw. ""Unfortunately no one was found alive in that family. The father and son were found dead and they are still looking for the mother and the daughter."" Rescuers stood atop the pancaked floors of one building in Amizmiz, bits of carpet and furniture protruding from the rubble. A long queue formed outside the only open shop as people sought supplies. Underlining the challenges facing rescuers, fallen boulders blocked a road from Amizmiz to a nearby village. Nearly all the houses in the area of Asni, some 40 km south of Marrakech, were damaged, and villagers were preparing to spend the night outside. Food was in short supply as roofs had collapsed on kitchens, said villager Mohamed Ouhammo. Montasir Itri, a resident of Asni, said the search was on for survivors. ""Our neighbours are under the rubble and people are working hard to rescue them using available means in the village,"" he said. The village of Tansghart in the Ansi area, on the side of a valley where the road from Marrakech rises up into the High Atlas, was the worst hit of any Reuters saw. Its once-pretty houses, clinging to a steep hillside, were cracked open by the shaking ground. Those still standing were missing chunks of wall or plaster. Two mosque minarets had fallen. Abdellatif Ait Bella, a labourer, lay on the ground, barely able to move or speak, his head bandaged from wounds caused by falling debris. ""We have no house to take him to and have had no food since yesterday,"" said his wife Saida Bodchich, fearing for the future of their family of six with their sole breadwinner so badly hurt. ""We can rely on nobody but God."" The village is already mourning ten deaths including two teenage girls, an inhabitant said. Tremors were felt as far away as Huelva and Jaen in southern Spain. The World Health Organization said more than 300,000 people were affected in Marrakech and surrounding areas. RUNNING FOR SHELTER Street camera footage in Marrakech showed the moment the earth began to shake, as men suddenly looked around and jumped up, and others ran for shelter into an alleyway and then fled as dust and debris tumbled around them. In the heart of the old city, a UNESCO World Heritage site, a mosque minaret had fallen in Jemaa al-Fna Square. Some houses in the tightly packed old city collapsed and people used their hands to remove debris while they waited for heavy equipment, said resident Id Waaziz Hassan. Morocco declared three days of national mourning, during which the national flag will be flown at half staff throughout the country, the royal court said on Saturday. The Moroccan armed forces will deploy rescue teams to provide affected areas with clean drinking water, food supplies, tents and blankets, it added. Turkey, where powerful earthquakes in February killed more than 50,000 people, was among nations expressing solidarity and offering to provide support. Algeria, which broke off ties with Morocco in 2021 after escalating tensions between the countries focused on the Western Sahara conflict, said it would open airspace for humanitarian and medical flights. The quake was recorded at a depth of 18.5 km, typically more destructive than deeper quakes of the same magnitude. It was Morocco's deadliest earthquake since 1960 when a quake was estimated to have killed at least 12,000 people, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Mohammad Kashani, associate professor of structural and earthquake engineering at the University of Southampton, compared scenes of the aftermath to images from Turkey in February: ""The area is full of old and historical buildings, which are mainly masonry. The collapsed reinforced concrete structures that I saw ... were either old or substandard."" Marrakech is due to host the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank from Oct. 9. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com An IMF spokesperson, asked about the planned meetings, said: ""Our sole focus at this time is on the people of Morocco and the authorities who are dealing with this tragedy.""

"Over 2,000 Dead In Morocco Quake, Red Cross Says Rebuilding To Take Years","In the mountain village near the epicentre, virtually no buildings were left standing Morocco's deadliest earthquake in decades has killed more than 2,000 people, authorities said Saturday, as troops and emergency services scrambled to reach remote mountain villages where victims are still feared trapped. Authorities declared three days of national mourning, but the Red Cross warned that it could take years to repair the damage. The 6.8-magnitude quake struck late Friday in a mountainous area 72 kilometres (45 miles) southwest of the tourist city of Marrakesh, the US Geological Survey reported. With strong tremors also felt in the coastal cities of Rabat, Casablanca and Essaouira, the quake caused widespread damage and sent terrified residents and tourists scrambling to safety in the middle of the night. ""I was nearly asleep when I heard the doors and the shutters banging,"" said Ghannou Najem, a Casablanca resident in her 80s who was visiting Marrakesh when the quake hit. ""I went outside in a panic. I thought I was going to die alone."" In the mountain village of Tafeghaghte near the quake's epicentre, virtually no buildings were left standing. The traditional clay bricks used by the region's Berber inhabitants proved no match for the rare quake. In the late afternoon, soldiers continued to search through debris, but most survivors headed to the cemetery where loud screams punctuated the last rites as some 70 villagers were laid to rest. ""Three of my grandchildren and their mother were killed -- they are still under the rubble,"" villager Omar Benhanna, 72, told AFP. ""Just a while ago, we were all playing together,"" he added. It was the strongest-ever quake to hit the North African kingdom, and one expert described it as the region's ""biggest in more than 120 years"". ""Where destructive earthquakes are rare, buildings are simply not constructed robustly enough... so many collapse, resulting in high casualties,"" said Bill McGuire, professor emeritus at Britain's University College London. The latest update from the interior ministry late Saturday showed the quake had killed at least 2,012 people, the vast majority in Al-Haouz, the epicentre, and Taroudant provinces. Another 2,059 people were injured, including 1,404 in a critical condition, the ministry said. Civil defence Colonel Hicham Choukri who is heading relief operations told state television earlier the epicentre and strength of the earthquake created ""an exceptional emergency situation"". After a meeting chaired by King Mohammed VI, the palace announced three days of national mourning, with flags to fly at half-mast on all public buildings. 'Unbearable' Screams Faisal Badour, an engineer, said he felt the quake three times in his building in Marrakesh. ""There are families who are still sleeping outside because we were so scared of the force of this earthquake,"" he said. ""The screaming and crying was unbearable."" Frenchman Michael Bizet, 43, who owns three traditional riad houses in Marrakesh's old town, told AFP he was in bed when the quake struck. ""I thought my bed was going to fly away. I went out into the street half-naked and immediately went to see my riads. It was total chaos, a real catastrophe, madness,"" he said. Footage on social media showed part of a minaret collapsed on Jemaa el-Fna square in the historic city. An AFP correspondent saw hundreds of people flocking to the square to spend the night for fear of aftershocks, some with blankets while others slept on the ground. Houda Outassaf, a local resident, said she was ""still in shock"" after feeling the earth shake beneath her feet -- and losing relatives. ""I have at least 10 members of my family who died... I can hardly believe it, as I was with them no more than two days ago,"" she said. The regional blood transfusion centre in Marrakesh called on residents to donate blood for the injured. The Royal Moroccan Football Federation announced that a Cup of African Nations qualifier against Liberia, due to have been played on Saturday in the coastal city of Agadir, had been postponed indefinitely. Significant Damage Likely ""We heard screams at the time of the tremor,"" a resident of Essaouira, 200 kilometres (125 miles) west of Marrakesh, told AFP. ""Pieces of facades have fallen."" The Red Cross said it was mobilising resources to support the Moroccan Red Crescent, but its Middle East and North Africa director, Hossam Elsharkawi, warned: ""We are looking at many months if not years of response."" Foreign leaders expressed their condolences and many offered assistance, including Israel with which Morocco normalised relations in 2020. Neighbour and regional rival Algeria announced it was suspending a two-year-old ban on all Moroccan flights through its airspace to enable aid deliveries and medical evacuations. US President Joe Biden said he was ""deeply saddened by the loss of life and devastation"". Chinese leader Xi Jinping expressed ""deep grief for the victims"" and hope that ""the Moroccan government and people will be able to overcome the impact of this disaster"". In 2004, at least 628 people were killed and 926 injured when a quake hit Al Hoceima in northeastern Morocco, and in 1960 a magnitude 6.7 quake in Agadir killed more than 12,000. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com The 7.3-magnitude El Asnam earthquake in Algeria killed 2,500 people and left at least 300,000 homeless in 1980.

"Over 420,000 Russian Soldiers Deployed In Occupied Areas: Ukraine","Ukraine troops are also contending with renewed assaults around Kharkiv in the northeast. (File) Kyiv estimates that Russia has deployed more than 400,000 soldiers in areas it controls in the east and south of Ukraine, Deputy Intelligence Chief Vadym Skibitsky said Saturday. ""The Russian Federation has concentrated more than 420,000 servicemen in our territories that are temporarily occupied, including Crimea,"" Skibitsky said at a conference in Kyiv. The figure ""does not include the Russian National Guard and other special units that maintain occupation authorities on our territories,"" he added. Skibitsky also said Russia had for a month been actively launching attacks from Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. ""Drones deployed in Crimea are used against our ports of Izmail and Reni,"" which have been used as alternative exports hub, particularly since the expiry of a deal protecting exports on the Black Sea. Ukraine launched a counteroffensive in the east and south in June but has come up against fierce resistance from entrenched Russian forces. Kyiv's troops are also contending with renewed assaults around Kharkiv in the northeast, in areas liberated last year. ""(Russians) want to take their revenge"" in the Kharkiv region, said Deputy Defence Minister Ganna Malyar.

"Morocco Quake Not In The Most Active Area, Aftershocks Expected: Expert","The powerful earthquake that struck Morocco, killed more than 2,000 people. The powerful earthquake that struck Morocco, killing more than 2,000 people, didn't hit in the most active seismological region, said one French expert. But aftershocks can be expected, he warned. Philippe Vernant -- a specialist in active tectonics, particularly in Morocco, at the University of Montpellier -- answered AFP's question's on the devastating quake. - Was the Morocco quake a surprise? - Morocco is one of those countries where the question is not whether there will be earthquakes. The Agadir earthquake (magnitude 5.7 in 1960) destroyed the entire city and killed almost 15,000 people, and more recently there was the Al Hoecima earthquake (magnitude 6.4 in 2004), further out on the Mediterranean. Looking further back in history, there were earthquakes in the 18th century, probably around magnitude 7 in the Fez region. The epicentre of the recent quake is not in the most active area of Morocco. But there are the High Atlas mountains... This type of earthquake is what leads to the rise of the High Atlas range. - Was the Morocco quake similar to the one in Turkey in February? - In Turkey, we had horizontal movement, because Turkey is shifting to the West, moving towards Greece. There was a horizontal sliding of the (tectonic) plates. Here, we're seeing more of a convergence between Africa and Eurasia or Iberia, the Spanish part, and overlapping faults... But we are still dealing with plate boundaries. - What explains the violence of the Morocco quake? - We need to see what magnitude the earthquake will be. We're talking about 6.8 or 6.9, which is quite strong. This corresponds roughly to an average displacement on the fault line of around one metre in a few seconds, over several kilometres. Obviously, this shakes the region enormously. Then there's the depth: at first it was estimated to be at around 25-30 kilometres, but it seems to be going back up, closer to 10 kilometres. The closer you get to the surface, the greater the effect of the rupture. This is what happened in France in 2019 in the Teil region in the (southern) Ardeche region. It was a ""small"" earthquake, but as it occurred at a depth of just one kilometre, it shook things up a lot. - Should we expect aftershocks in Morocco? - Aftershocks are bound to occur. Even if they are less strong, they can lead to the collapse of buildings already weakened by the earthquake. Traditionally, we tend to say that aftershocks diminish in intensity. But in Turkey, one earthquake triggered another. The first tear can lead to the rupture of another fault through a cascade effect, which is why there is sometimes a risk of a stronger earthquake after the first one. - Is it possible to predict this kind of event? - Unfortunately, we can't predict anything. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com We try to estimate recurrence periods according to the different magnitudes of the earthquakes, but then the behaviour can be chaotic, with two strong earthquakes over a short period and then nothing for a very long time.

"Saudi Arabia, US Sign Agreement To Establish Green Transit Corridor","Saudi Arabia welcomed the role of the US for the establishment of green corridors. Saudi Arabia and the United States on Friday signed a bilateral memorandum of understanding (MoU) for establishing intercontinental green transit corridors through the Kingdom to connect the continent of Asia with the continent of Europe. The project aims to facilitate the transit of renewable electricity and clean hydrogen via transmission cables and pipelines as well as constructing rail linkages. It is also intended to enhance energy security, support efforts for the development of clean energy, promote digital economy through digital connectivity and transmission of data via fibre cables, and promote trade and transport of goods by rail and through ports, as per a release issued by Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Saudi Arabia welcomed the role of the US in facilitating, and supporting the negotiations for the establishment, and implementation of the green corridors transit protocol with the relevant countries. Meanwhile, United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently began his Saudi Arabia visit with a meeting with Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

American teen Gauff wins US Open for first major,"NEW YORK -- Coco Gauff won her first major title on Saturday at the US Open with a 2-6, 6-3, 6-2 victory over Aryna Sabalenka in front of an adoring crowd under the roof on a stormy day at Arthur Ashe Stadium. After the match, the 19-year-old American fell to the ground and lay on her back on the court before sobbing in celebration. After hugging Sabalenka, Gauff ran up the stairs to tearfully hug her parents and then the rest of her team. Moments later, Gauff told the star-studded crowd, which included Kevin Durant, Diane Keaton, Nicole Kidman, Spike Lee, Mindy Kaling and 2006 champion Maria Sharapova, that she still hadn't fully processed the victory. ""Oh my goodness, it means so much to me,"" Gauff told ESPN's Mary Joe Fernandez. ""I feel like I'm a little bit in shock in this moment. That [2022] French Open loss was a heartbreak for me. But I realized God put you through tribulations and trials and that makes this moment even sweeter than I could have imagined."" After the match, several high-profile celebrities, including former President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama and President Joe Biden, sent her congratulatory messages over social media. Gauff is the youngest American to win the US Open since Serena Williams in 1999 and the first American player to win a major title since Sofia Kenin at the Australian Open in 2020. Gauff also became the first woman to win the title in New York after dropping the first set in three matches during her title run since Williams, also in 1999. When speaking to the media after the match, Gauff said it was an honor to have her name listed on the same trophy as Williams and her sister Venus, who won the title a combined eight times. ""I mean, they're the reason why I have this trophy today, to be honest,"" Gauff said. ""They have allowed me to believe in this dream. Growing up, there weren't too many Black tennis players dominating the sport. It was literally, at that time when I was younger, it was just them that I can remember. ""Obviously more came because of their legacy, so it made the dream more believable. But all the things that they had to go through, they made it easier for someone like me to do this."" Gauff, the tournament's No. 6 seed, was broken in the first game of the match and struggled to find any rhythm in the nervy 40-minute opening set. Since the first set winner had won 27 of the previous 28 US Open women's finals, history was not on her side. But she took control in the second set, breaking Sabalenka in the fourth game and recording an 81% win percentage on first serve. Her confidence grew with every point, and her ""Come on!"" screams and fist pumps became increasingly more animated. In the deciding set, it was all Gauff. She jumped to a 4-0 lead and withheld Sabalenka's last-ditch efforts and a medical timeout at 4-1. After two hours and six minutes, Gauff was the US Open champion. ""You played unbelievable,"" Sabalenka said to Gauff during the on-court trophy ceremony. ""Congrats to you and your team, you guys deserve this title. Many more to come, I'm pretty sure."" Despite still being a teenager, Gauff has been one of the sport's most recognizable stars since she burst onto the scene at Wimbledon in 2019 and reached the fourth round as a 15-year-old qualifier. Since then, she's won five WTA titles and reached the final at the 2022 French Open. With several high-profile sponsorship deals and a growing presence on social media, Gauff has remained under the spotlight and the expectations for her career have continued to increase. On Saturday, Gauff said the pressure has been overwhelming at times, and she felt she was expected to immediately win a major title after her run to the fourth round at Wimbledon in 2019. ""It's been difficult,"" she said. ""I mean, it's been a long journey to this point. I wasn't a fully developed player, and I still think I have a lot of development to go. At that moment, I think people were putting a lot of pressure on me to win. I felt that at 15 I had to win a Slam at 15. ""I think that was, you know, not the mistake, because everything led to this moment so there were no mistakes, but that was a little bit of the pressure that I was feeling. Now I just realize that I just need to go out there and try my best."" After losing in the first round at Wimbledon in July, Gauff brought in a new team, including coach Pere Riba and consultant Brad Gilbert. Since then, she's won the titles in Washington D.C., and Cincinnati and is 18-1 during the current hard-court swing. She defeated two Grand Slam champions en route to the final, as well as 2023 French Open runner-up Karolina Muchova in the semifinals. Gauff told the crowd she had been motivated by those who had doubted her. ""I want to say honestly thank you to the people who didn't believe in me,"" Gauff said. ""A month ago, I won a 500 title and people said, I would stop at that. Two weeks ago, I won a 1000 title and people were saying that was the biggest it was going to get. So three weeks later, I'm here with this trophy right now. ""I've tried my best to carry this with grace and I've been doing my best. So honestly, to those who thought they were putting water on my fire, you were really adding gas to it. And now I'm really burning so bright right now."" Gauff later told reporters she had been reading comments online from those who didn't think she was going to win right up until the match. In addition to earning $3 million for the victory -- something she thanked Billie Jean King for fighting for as she received it -- Gauff will improve to a career-high ranking of No. 3 on Monday. Sabalenka, the reigning Australian Open champion, will take over the No. 1 ranking for the first time despite the loss. Gauff will also return to the top spot in the doubles ranking, alongside partner Jessica Pegula. The pair reached the quarterfinals at the US Open.",sports
UFC 293 Adesanya vs. Strickland: Live results and analysis,"To be clear, Sean Strickland has fought in the UFC since 2014, and his résumé is undeniably strong during that time. But the primary reason he is challenging Israel Adesanya for the middleweight championship at UFC 293 this weekend in Sydney is that Adesanya wants him there. Adesanya (24-2) will seek his seventh championship win on Saturday, against an outspoken challenger in Strickland (27-5). The UFC wanted Adesanya to defend his title against Dricus du Plessis, but Du Plessis wasn't available on the date and Adesanya pushed, forcibly, for Strickland to take his place. The defending champion eventually got his wish, and Strickland, who holds wins over ranked opponents but is only 2-2 in his past four appearances, will try to take advantage of the biggest opportunity of his career in Australia.

Several factors lead to suicides, including poverty, unemployment, the loss of a loved one, arguments and legal or work-related problems, among others. According to WHO, suicides account for nearly half of all violent deaths in the world. Social norms play a significant role in the development of suicidal behaviours. World Suicide Prevention Day 2023 Date World Suicide Prevention Day 2023 will be observed on Sunday, September 10. World Suicide Prevention Day Significance World Suicide Prevention Day is an important day as it sheds light on the global issue of suicide and its impact on families and communities. The stigma associated with seeking help in times of need is one of the main barriers that leads to more suicides. World Suicide Prevention Day encourages open conversations about mental health, depression, anxiety, or any other type of emotional distress, which helps people express their feelings and emotions. The day holds great significance as it promotes support services and assistance to individuals who may be struggling with suicidal thoughts to make sure suicide mortality rates are reduced.

How Virat Kohli and Shubman Gill prepared for Pakistan pace test,"Listen to Story The spotlight will be on India's top order when they line up against a confident Pakistan side in what promises to be a blockbuster Asia Cup 2023 Super Fours match at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Sunday, September 10. The top-order's frailties against top-quality opposition in crunch matches have been a recurring theme with India. From the 2017 Champions Trophy final to the recent Group A match of the Asia Cup against , the big guns at the top have failed to fire when it mattered the most for the team. India have acknowledged the concern in the recent past, but a familiar story unraveled in Pallekele when Shaheen Shah Afridi ran through the top-order. The left-arm pacer got it to swing both ways and went through the defence of captain Rohit Sharma and former captain Virat Kohli. Haris Rauf also joined the party, removing Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer as India slipped to 66 for 4. Thanks to Ishan Kishan and Hardik Pandya's counter-attacking eighties, India managed to steer out of trouble and post 266 before rain gods played spoilsport last week. As it turns out, India put in the hard yards at the nets in Colombo, making good use of their 5-day break between their win over Nepal and their first Super Fours match. Shubman Gill stole the attention during the training sessions India had in the lead-up to the Super Fours match against Pakistan. India had two optional training sessions and a compulsory full-fledged practice session on Friday and Gill was out in the middle on all three days. The young opener, who has been struggling for big scores and consistency since the end of the IPL 2023 season, batted for a long time against left-arm throw-down specialist, Nuwan Seneviratne. Gill seems to have been particular about preparing himself for the challenge that Shaheen is expected to pose in the Super Fours match, as the left-arm pacer has his tail up after having shone against India in Pallekele. Gill explained the role of Seneviratne while speaking to the press on the eve of the match in Colombo, while acknowledging that India batters don't have enough exposure to high-quality left-arm pace bowling. ""We have two right-arm throwdown side-arm specialists, and as a variation, we also have a left-arm side-arm specialist. It helps in various conditions,"" Gill said. ""Before getting to this level, every batter would have faced left-arm bowling at some stage. Whenever you play a new bowler it makes a difference, [more so] because we don't play Pakistan as often as we do some other teams. Coming up against a quality bowling attack like Pakistan's, makes a difference,"" he added. Apart from Gill, India also had comeback man KL Rahul visit the nets on all three days of training in Colombo. While Rahul kept wickets on Friday, he worked meticulously on his batting on the other two days. It remains to be seen if Rahul will get the nod to slot into the XI for the big-ticket game. Meanwhile, Virat Kohli, known for his meticulous preparations, geared up for the big contest, facing Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami who were going full tilt against him at the nets. Jasprit Bumrah warmed up at the nets on Friday, bowing to Rohit Sharma. As he began hitting full steam, it was time for him to bowl at Virat Kohli, who was a first-change at the nets after Rohit walked away. Keeping in mind the challenge Naseem Shah and Haris Rauf are going to pose, Kohli took on Bumrah who did not shy away from testing his former captain at the nets, according to Star Sports. Both Virat and Rohit faced throwdown specialists, especially asking for different lines and lengths in a bid to prepare themselves for the big challenge. Moreover, India also had their bowlers do batting practice at the nets. Kuldeep Yadav batted close to an hour while Mohammed Siraj was also seen getting a hit at the nets. In fact, Siraj took to social media to share the photos of him donning the helmet and batting gear during training. India will be hoping to negate the Pakistan pace-bowling threat at the top and build confidence as they gear up for the ultimate battle at the World Cup.",sports
"Labuschagne is putting his hand up, making most of those opportunities: Warner","Listen to Story David Warner heaped praise on Marnus Labuschagne and has said that the Australian batter is making the most out of his opportunities after another Player Of The Match performance against South Africa on Saturday. Labuschagne and Warner showcased their prowess in the second ODI against South Africa. Labuschagne scored a remarkable 124 runs, contributing significantly to Australia's mammoth total of 8-392, which is their third-highest ODI total. This performance was instrumental in Australia's victory over South Africa by 123 runs, leading to a two-nil series lead. Warner also had an exceptional performance in the same match. He hit 12 fours and three sixes to reach a century in just 85 deliveries. This marked his 20th century in One-Day Internationals at the opening slot. Notably, this was Warner's 46th century as an opening batter in international cricket, breaking the record previously held by Sachin Tendulkar. The combined efforts of Labuschagne and Warner led to a comprehensive dismantling of South Africa, with the Proteas only managing to score 269 runs from 41.5 overs in reply. Labuschagne's inclusion in the World Cup squad has been a hot topic of discussion at the moment, with the Aussie batter that it's not something that is in his control. Speaking after the win on Saturday, as quoted by Fox Sports, Warner weighed in on the matter. The opener hailed Labuschagne as a quality player and revealed that the selectors had talked to him about the World Cup. Warner feels that Labuschagne could come in as a like-for-like replacement for Steve Smith, who has been dealing with an injury at the moment. Warner feels that Labuschagne has put his hand up and is making the most of the opportunities given to him. “Marnus is a quality player,” Warner told reporters in the post-match press conference. “He played extremely well â?æ he’s in a good place. “The selectors have spoken to Marnus. I think quite clearly you can see that it’s a like-for-like replacement with (Steve) Smith."" “We’ve got extreme firepower and a lot of all-rounders as well, which is always handy in this format, but then again, form is the greatest thing for selection."" “He’s putting his hand up, he’s making the most of those opportunities, and you’ll have to wait and see what selectors say.”",sports

Babar Azam's Bold Declaration As Pakistan Take On India In Super 4 Clash,"Pakistan skipper Babar Azam on Saturday said the recent experience of playing in Sri Lankan conditions will give his side an edge over India in Sunday's Asia Cup Super 4 clash. Several Pakistan players have been playing in Sri Lanka since the Test series in July, followed by the Lanka Premier League and the bilateral ODIs against Afghanistan. “Given the continuous cricket we are playing both in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, you can say that we hold an edge (over India),"" said Babar in the pre-match press conference. “We have been playing here in Sri Lanka for the past two months or so. We have played Tests, we played a series against Afghanistan, and then the LPL... So it can be said that we have an advantage.” Babar's side had to shuttle between Sri Lanka and Pakistan because of the tournament schedule, but the right-handed batter did not read too much into it. “We always knew the schedule and how much we have to travel. So, it's become important how we look after our players. We have planned everything well,” he said. Pakistan pacers have been doing exceedingly well in the Asia Cup as Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haris Rauf, and Naseem Shah have so far taken 23 wickets among them from just three matches. However, Babar exhorted his spinners to join the party in the middle overs so that the pressure applied on opponents does not slip. “Yes, we get a good start (with the ball) and the plan always is to bowl good in middle overs. The effort is to have an effective combination. We need wickets in the middle overs but we are not getting them. “But you can see that we are finishing good. Our pacers are doing well at the end. This is a team performance. If someone fails, then another bowler chips in,” said Babar. This is the second time India and Pakistan are meeting each other in the tournament after their league match at Pallekele ended in a washout. Babar hoped the weather would stay clear on Sunday. “We are focusing on what is in our control. The way the sun is beaming, I don't think it will rain a lot (tomorrow). We are trying to do as much practice as we can,” he added. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",sports

Days after the 'Men in Green' took their place at the top of the table in the Men's ODI Team Rankings, Australia reclaimed their spot with a win in the second ODI against South Africa. After winning a thriller in the first match in Bloemfontein, Australia won the second ODI by 123 runs.

Sooraj: I’ve been in a relationship for 7 yrs,"The ‘Hero’ actor, Sooraj Pancholi, who was acquitted in the Jiah Khan case in April, talks about love, marriage and his career Sooraj Pancholi Life is looking up for Sooraj Pancholi both on personal and professional fronts. However, rising above the challenging phase of fighting a decade-long legal case wasn’t easy. Sooraj and his family (parents and Aditya Pancholi ) heaved a sigh of relief when he was acquitted in the suicide case by a special CBI court in April this year. He says, “Only I know what I went through, as only I had to get back home alone, wake up, and fight the scenario again. I couldn’t leave the country due to travel restrictions and as a result, I lost out on films and shows.” Not only were there travel restrictions, but work offers were reduced as the case continued. Sooraj says, “I understand why producers and people were slightly hesitant. If I were a producer, I would have the same concerns. I have always been realistic. I knew the entertainment industry would not always be glitzy, glamourous, and easy even before I stepped into it, and I was prepared for it. People often say, ‘ ’ and that you needn’t worry when you know that you are not wrong. But at the end of the day, we are all humans, and it does affect us.” Despite a tumultuous past, Sooraj didn’t lose faith in love. In fact, he surprised us by disclosing that he has been in a steady relationship. He shares, “I think my relationship with Jiah was probably the shortest relationship I have had. After that, I have been in one relationship and it’s been about seven years now, and it is beautiful. There’s nothing in the world that can match up to the feeling of being in love, being taken care of, and doing the same for the other person. For me, this relationship it’s very personal because many have judged me unfairly as a bad lover or partner, but only those close to me know how I am. The general perception is misconstrued. She is not an actress and hence, I wouldn’t want to divulge her identity. Besides, I prefer to keep my relationship private because so much about me is out there already.” We ask if marriage on the cards, and he says, “Maybe, in a few years.” On the work front, the actor, who will soon be seen alongside Nimrit Kaur Ahluwalia in a single titled ‘Jaane Jaa’, a recreation of the 70s iconic song ‘Jaane Jaan Dhoondta Phir Raha’ (‘Jawani Diwani’), which has been re-produced by DJ Chetas and sung by Atif Aslam and Asees Kaur, is excited about having a busy year ahead. He looks forward to shooting for a web series (a period drama) and an action film. He says, “I would love to be part of a full-blown action film as I am an ardent fan of this genre.” Sooraj says, “People chase money or fame as a mark of their success; however, freedom has been the biggest success in my life. I didn’t have that as a 20-year-old boy. Now that I have found it, I truly understand the value of freedom. It’s a relief that my past no longer haunts me.” Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Lifestyle Entertainment tv Entertainment tv Lifestyle",entertainment

India vs Pakistan: Kohli 'On Song' But Rohit A 'Worry' For Team In Super 4,"As India gear up to ace the Pakistan test in the Asia Cup 2023 Super 4 clash on Sunday in Colombo, the team management has a big concern to handle. Historically, the venue hasn't been as productive for Rohit Sharma , as he would've liked. Virat Kohli , in comparison, has done wonders at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. While getting the entire Indian team click as a unit will be key for the Indian team, the skipper's performance against the mighty Pakistan bowling attack could lay the foundation of which way the fixture will turn. Virat Kohli's Record in Colombo: Virat Kohli remains one of the finest run-getters in the history of the game and Colombo has been a happy hunting ground for him. Kohli has played eight ODIs so far at the venue and aggregated 519 runs at a Don Brandman-esque average of 103.80. He has scored a whopping three centuries so far in Colombo, with his highest score being 131. In fact, Virat's last three innings scores in Colombo read, 110*, 131, 128*. All of these runs had come against Sri Lanka. Having failed to deliver against Pakistan in the group stage clash, Kohli would be keen to turn things around in the Super 4 clash. Rohit Sharma's Record in Colombo: While Kohli has been in stunning form at the venue, Rohit Sharma's record has been awful. The India skipper has also played nine ODIs in Colombo but managed to aggregate just 196 runs at a below-par average of 24.50. In these 9 games, Rohit has only scored one century. While Rohit's record doesn't speak in favour of Rohit, he had a phenomenal outing against Nepal in the last match. The message from the team management would be more of the same for the India captain. The Indian team's performances have been in focus for a long time, especially as critics look to judge what Rohit Sharma's men are capable of in the ODI World Cup 2023. While many consider Pakistan the favourites to go the distance in the Asia Cup, how India fare against them in the Super 4 clash might just help the pundits gauge the true ability of the subcontinent giants.",sports

"""Wasn't The Typical Shaheen..."": Ex-India Star's Warning To Rohit's Men","Shaheen Afridi was the pick of Pakistan bowlers during the Asia Cup 2023 group stage match against India with four wickets including that of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli . He had a brilliant run of form against the top-order batters with his swing bowling causing major troubles for Gill, Kohli and Rohit. When the two teams face each in the Super 4 stage on Sunday, the onus will be on Shaheen once again to provide Pakistan with a good start and former India cricketer Former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar had a warning for Rohit and Co. In an interaction with Star Sports, Manjrekar analysed Shaheen's performance against India. ""The opening phase had two spells; in the first spell before the rain had come, he was bowling typical Shaheen Afridi kind of deliveries. He was bowling further up the pitch, trying to get the ball to swing inwards, and that length was being played very well by Shubman Gill and Rohit Sharma,"" he said. ""And after the rain, someone must have spoken to Shaheen Afridi, and after the break, he brought his length back and in that length, the good length, Rohit Sharma got out, and so did Virat. So it wasn't the typical Shaheen Afridi kind of delivery that troubled the Indian batters, but the shorter length, meaning the movement from the pitch made them out,"" Manjrekar added during the interaction. An India-Pakistan clash remains one of the most hotly anticipated matches in world cricket because the two South Asian neighbours only play each other in multi-nation tournaments due to political tensions.

"G20 not appropriate forum to discuss Russia's war in Ukraine, says Brazil President Lula da Silva","World G20 not appropriate forum to discuss Russia's war in Ukraine, says Brazil President Lula da Silva Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on Saturday said that G20 is a forum to discuss economic issues as it was built after the 2008-2009 global financial crisis and that it is not an appropriate forum to talk about Russia's war in Ukraine FP Staff Last Updated:September 10, 2023 11:08:00 IST Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. ANI Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on Saturday said that G20 is a forum to discuss economic issues as it was built after the 2008-2009 global financial crisis and that it is not an appropriate forum to talk about Russia’s war in Ukraine. In an exclusive interview to Firstpost , Lula da Silva said, “G20 is a forum that was built because of the 2008 and 2009 global financial crisis. From there onwards, the G20 started to discuss many economic issues, and… Wood institutions were also started to be discussed, the World Bank, the IMF… In attempt to try to improve the functioning of these multilateral institutions. That’s why we didn’t want to here in India, we would discuss the war between Ukraine and Russia. This is not the appropriate forum for that.” Watch full interview here : Related Articles German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Brazilian President Lula arrive for G20 Summit G20 Summit: 3 private hospitals among 8 medical facilities put on 'high alert' He said on 19 September we will have the General Assembly of the UN and that’s the place for us to discuss the war. “That’s the place for us to try to discuss peace. That’s the place for us to call Putin and Zelensky in a negotiation table because no one wants war. Everybody is against war. We want peace. So it’s necessary for us to establish a conversation policy so that we can try to convince the two presidents for Russia and Ukraine that the war is not the solution for anything and that the dialogue, the diplomacy and a table of dialogue could help much more,” said the President. He said that Brazil’s position has been very clear from the beginning on the war efforts. “From the beginning, Brazil has been saying that we do not want to participate in the war efforts. Brazil wants to participate in the peace effort. We want to try to negotiate as also India, thinks like that, China, thinks like that. Many other countries think like Brazil, and so that’s why we believe that it’s very important that the war issue should not be included in the document, in the declaration from the G20. That’s very important,” said Lula da Silva. He said otherwise people would go to war and then we lose and waste time instead of discussing the problems that involve nine billion inhabitants, the hunger that is affecting 735 million people, unemployment of millions of people. And we stay here discussing something that is not our top priority. “And so I believe that it was very important, the decision that was made to not to allow that the war would come in into our declaration. The declaration is very serious, minded. It’s a mandatory reading for all of us that participated in the G20, and I hope that it serves as a guideline, as a roadmap, so that we can, in Rio next year to do something even better,” said the Brazilian President. He said now is the time for G20 to target actual policies and commit to make things change rather than just discuss, talk philosophy. “Now we have to start to go to actual policies. Now we’re going to go to a phase that G20 doesn’t have to stay anymore, just discussing and philosophy. No, we have to take commitments to make things change, to do things. The climate change issue is very serious. Mind that we have to do something about it. Brazil is taking the commitment of reaching 2030 with zero deforestation. We have already ended hunger in Brazil once in the past, and now we have 33 million that are in hunger once again,” said the President. When asked if this consensus in a way is a win for New Delhi and establishes India as a rising power in an increasingly divided world, he said, “India will always be a power because a country that has tremendous 1000 year culture, is a country that was already colonised, a country that managed to get its Independence…. India is always a country that you have to take very seriously, very respected..” He said what’s happening with the climate change around the world is not a joke and most certain thing that exists today is that we are lacking the responsibility when we deal with the issue. “If someone still has doubts that the climate, nothing will happen with the climate, I can reassure you that the most certain thing that exists today is that we are lacking with responsibility when we deal with the climate change and we’re being the victim of the lack of attention of humanity,” he added. “…We still have time. We have to take care of the planet. I believe that this meeting will give a very good guideline to all countries so that we can manage to put in practice a good policy, so that we can take care with great care of our planet Earth, of their forest, of its water, so that we can live well,” said Lula. On India’s G20 agenda and the progress that has been made so far, Lula said, “I think it was an extraordinary, the India agenda that they developed and the promotion of 60 debates or more in different cities in Brazil. Many ministers came to these meetings. We had the health minister, we had the mines and energy minister from Brazil, we had the science and technology minister, the enormous amount. The labor minister came here, and then the finance minister came to these meetings. So these hundreds of meetings involving thousands of people is a new way that India is teaching us that it’s not surface for the presidents of the countries to participate. It’s necessary for us to involve the government as a whole and that we should involve the people that should participate in the debate. We learned a lot. Since we’re going to host next year the G20 in Brazil, we will take from India many teachings so that we can have a G20 meeting as productive as we had here in India.” When asked how did Brazil and others prevail upon the European and the G7 countries, who seemed intent on having their way with the language vis-a-vis Ukraine, to ensure that there was consensus on the declaration, Lula said, “Well, this is already a majority that is being formed within the countries. On the BRICS, for example, we didn’t discuss the war during the BRICS Summit meeting. We thought that there’s other forum to discuss the war, and we could bring to India a debate, a discussion that has more consequence in Europe because they’re involved directly in the war, and the US is also directly involved in the war. But the other countries are not involved directly in the war. The other countries are involved in a policy…” On his visit to New Delhi and the first day at G20 Summit, he said, “…this G20 is a G20 that is exceptionally very well organised. We had, I would say, a lot of work. I arrived last night, and today we had two sessions that were hard work, and we had some other parallel events that were also very important. We launched a commitment together with Prime Minister, Modi, and President Biden, with Argentina, with the Indonesia commitment to follow biofuel policy that is very strong so that we can fight the greenhouse gas effect so that we can diminish the use of oil and try to use biofuel. So that was very important. This initiative, this commitment, that was assumed by all the presidents that participated together with Prime Minister, Modi. I am convinced that we will come out of this meeting with some guidelines where the countries, what would they have to do from here onwards so that we can diminish the inequality between the peoples, inequality amongst the countries so that the world could have lived in a better way and above all, so that we can confront the climate issue with great responsibility.” Published on: September 10, 2023 11:02:22 IST TAGS: Brazil President G20 Summit Lula Da Silva",world
"Shubman Gill Gives ""World Class"" Verdict On Babar Azam","India and Pakistan are set to take on each other in a Super 4 game of Asia Cup 2023 on Sunday. On the eve of the clash, India opener Shubman Gill said that Pakistan's star batter Babar Azam is a ""world-class player"" and that the Indian team also admires him. The ongoing continental event has been a good one for the Pakistan skipper so far. In two innings across three matches, Babar has scored 168 runs at an average of 84. When questioned by a journalist if the Indian players also follow the game of Pakistan batters like Babar, Gill said: ""Yes, definitely we follow him. When a player is doing well. Everyone watches him to find out why they are doing so good, what their specialty is. The same thing goes for Babar. He is a world-class player and we all do admire him."" India and Pakistan have already faced each other in the tournament previously. The match took place in Pallekele on September 2. However, it was eventually called off due to rain. India were bowled out for 266 runs as Shaheen Afridi picked a four-wicket haul. The left-arm pacer kept the Indian team at bay despite fifties from Hardik Pandya (87) and Ishan Kishan (82). Pakistan could not start their chase as rain eventually forced the match to be abandoned. While talking about India's strategy for the upcoming match against the arch-rivals, Gill said: ""Our plans will be the same, to give a solid foundation and then dominate. In that last game against Pakistan, our top order did not do well. But still, we made around 260 and looked set to make 310-320 runs at some point at such a wicket. These are good signs."" The Indian team management's predicament to choose between KL Rahul and Ishan Kishan will be the dominating theme amid the usual edgy emotional quotient, when they face arch-rivals Pakistan in the most-awaited Super 4 match. Alongside focusing on the team goals, the Indian management will want to assemble the best possible XI in the park against Pakistan, whom the Rohit Sharma -led outfit is facing for the second time in the event. But for that, they need to find answers for the aforementioned puzzle, and hope that rains will stay away despite adding a controversial reserve day to the match on Monday.

Buzzing breakthrough: genetic engineering gives mosquito control an upgrade,"Throughout human history, mosquitoes have constantly buzzed in the background of human existence, irritating us with their incessant bites and occasionally wreaking havoc by transmitting deadly diseases. The earliest known mosquitoes from the fossil record date back at least 70 million years, and evidence of mosquito-borne diseases like malaria dates back to Egyptian mummies from 2000 BC. Apart from malaria, which claims the lives of over half a million people every year and infects close to 250 million, mosquitoes serve as vectors for various other diseases. These include dengue, Zika, lymphatic filariasis, and yellow fever. Understandably, our relationship with these tiny, blood-sucking insects has been far from cordial. The rapid urbanisation of the world’s populations, especially in many large and economically developing countries like India, has led to annual surges in mosquito-borne illnesses like dengue. Together with climate change and its cascading consequences, mosquito-borne diseases have expanded into new territories. A notable example is the indigenous cases of dengue in France in recent years. It is not surprising then that mosquito control has taken centrestage today and the battle continues unrelenting with an array of tools – from mosquito nets to insecticides and the use of symbionts like Wolbachia . But with insecticide resistance in mosquitoes rising to alarming proportions, it has become imperative that newer approaches to mosquito control gain prominence, even despite the availability of a first-generation malaria vaccine that officials in different countries are currently implementing in a pilot in endemic regions. In the last two decades, our ability to read or sequence the genomes of organisms, and edit and manipulate these genomes, has given us new tools in this fight. Thanks to advancements in next-generation sequencing techniques, we now have access to the whole genome sequences of multiple mosquito species. Notably, researchers from the University of California, the Tata Institute of Genetics and Society, and the Institute of Bioinformatics and Applied Biotechnology have helped prepare high-quality reference genomes for Anopheles stephensi , a major malaria-vector mosquito. (The two latter institutes are based in Bengaluru.) The availability of these high-quality sequences, coupled with our capacity to genetically manipulate them, offers unprecedented opportunities. The fundamental idea behind genetic manipulation of mosquitoes is to systematically control their populations by interfering with their reproduction. Scientists worldwide have developed various genetic modification approaches. A major one in this endeavour is gene-drive technology, whose end result is for mosquitoes to selectively inherit some genes, rather than the inheritance to follow the rules of Mendelian genetics. This technology was conceived by Austin Burt, professor at Imperial College London, in a 2003 paper published in Royal Society Proceedings . Here, a protein cuts the mosquito’s DNA at a part that doesn’t encode a particular sequence in the genome. This triggers a natural mechanism in the cell containing the DNA to repair it and forces the cell to incorporate a sequence, called the drive sequence , into the damaged portion. Numerous gene-drive versions are documented in the literature, but they all focus on reducing mosquito populations’ reproductive capabilities or rendering them sterile. As a result, the malaria parasite won’t be able to replicate inside the mosquito’s gut. In a recent paper in Science Advances , researchers at Imperial College London genetically enhanced a gene expressed in the midgut of mosquitoes to secrete two antimicrobial substances called magainin 2 and melittin. They are detrimental to the Plasmodium parasite’s development in the midgut and also reduce the lifespan of female mosquitoes. Computational modelling studies have suggested that this approach could significantly disrupt malaria transmission. In 2020, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency authorised the release of a genetically modified mosquito called OX5034 in counties in Florida and Texas. Oxitec developed this mosquito with a gene sensitive to an antibiotic, tetracycline. The authorisation followed extensive field trials conducted by the company in Brazil. Genetically modified male OX5034 mosquitoes mated with female mosquitoes but the self-limiting gene prevented female offspring from surviving. As a result, the male mosquitoes would disappear from the environment after around a dozen generations. Genetically modified mosquitoes have been used in outdoor but controlled conditions in India, Brazil, and Panama as well. Early results from these trials showed promising drops in mosquito populations, around 90% during the trials. Additional trials have shown that such technologies can decrease incidence of dengue significantly as well. These technologies can bring benefits as well as risks, in different ways. An immediate implication is that the drastic reduction in the mosquito population could alter food chains and ecosystems that involve mosquitoes. So it’s likely that the gap in the food chain could be ‘invaded’ by other mosquitoes or in fact other insects. As such, we don’t fully understand the implications in the short and longer terms. And since the consequences will be shared by individuals, communities, and populations, in that order, what constitutes a right decision and what processes are to be followed remains a dilemma to policymakers. It is therefore not surprising that the genetic engineering of mosquitoes and trials involving genetically modified mosquitoes have faced multifaceted challenges in different parts of the world. Critics have expressed concerns about unintended consequences, such as unforeseen ecological disruptions or the potential for engineered genes to spread beyond target mosquito populations. Some of these concerns are valid and require extensive data collection, close monitoring, and multistakeholder discussions surrounding the adoption of this technology. Closer home, on the regulatory front, the Department of Biotechnology released comprehensive guidelines for genetically engineered insects earlier this year. They provide a roadmap for researchers, outlining procedures and regulations for working with such insects in the country. The battle between mosquitoes and humankind seems to be a timeless struggle, a testament to human ingenuity against frustrating troublemakers aided by evolution.

"Will Rahul, Shami Make It To Playing XI Against Pakistan In Super 4 Clash?","Team India will be squaring off against Pakistan in their Asia Cup 2023 Super Four match on Sunday in Colombo. In their previous meeting in the group stage on September 2, rain played a spoilsport and both the teams had to share points as the match got abandoned. The Indian team management's predicament to choose between KL Rahul and Ishan Kishan will be the dominating theme amid the usual edgy emotional quotient. Alongside focusing on the team goals, the Indian management will want to assemble the best possible 11 in the park against Pakistan, whom the Rohit Sharma -led outfit is facing for the second time in the event. Here is what we think could be the playing XI of India vs Pakistan: Rohit Sharma: The India skipper failed to leave a mark in their previous match as he fell prey to Shaheen Afridi 's fiery spell. However, he redeemed himself in the next match against Nepal as he scored an unbeaten 74 and guided Team India to a 10-wicket win. Rohit will now aim for a better performance against Pakistan, especially Shaheen. Shubman Gill : The young opening batter visibly struggled in the first match against Pakistan and was dismissed for 10. Later, he went on to play an unbeaten knock of 67 runs against Nepal. Gill now needs to provide Team India with a good start against Pakistan. Virat Kohli : The superstar of Indian batting nit is slowly and gradually getting back in his groove. He got dismissed for four by Shaheen Afridi in their previous meeting. He once again needs to show his batting prowess in order to give Team India an upper hand in the game against Pakistan. Ishan Kishan : The young wicketkeeper-batter turned out to be a star for Team India as he played a crucial knock of 82 against Pakistan. His performance guided India to a good total of 266. He has also brilliantly fulfilled the role of a wicketkeeper in the absence of KL Rahul. Shreyas Iyer : The 28-year-old batter departed for 14 in the previous match against Pakistan. Later, he did not get an opportunity to bat against Nepal. However, the experienced right-handed batter will definitely find himself a place in the match against Pakistan. Hardik Pandya : The Indian vice-captain left everyone utterly impressed with his heroics in the match against Pakistan. The all-rounder stitched a massive partnership with Ishan Kishan and played a knock of 87 runs. Later in the match against Nepal, he also scalped one wicket. Ravindra Jadeja : The presence of the player in the playing XI provides more balance to the team. Apart from playing crucial knocks, Jadeja is too good a bowler to face on turning tracks. In the previous match against Nepal, Jadeja scalped three wickets while he scored 14 runs against Pakistan. Advertisement Kuldeep Yadav : T he left-arm wrist spinner failed to leave a mark in the match against Nepal as he leaked 34 runs in 10 overs and went wicketless. He will definitely aim for a better performance in the next match. Jasprit Bumrah : The star pacer missed out on the match against Nepal as he flew to Mumbai, to attend the birth of his baby boy. However, he expected to return on the field in the match against Pakistan as his pace is really crucial for the team. Mohammed Siraj : The 29-year-old pacer impressed everybody with his ultimate pace and took a three-wicket haul. He will aim to deliver a similar performance in the next match. Mohammed Shami: The senior pacer was benched in the first game as the team went ahead with Shardul Thakur . However, he was included in the next match against Nepal after Bumrah left the camp. He took one wicket and is expected to deliver a better performance in the next match.",sports
"Elon Musk is on a mission to create the world’s first AGI, an AI that is as smart as humans","Tech Elon Musk is on a mission to create the world’s first AGI, an AI that is as smart as humans Elon Musk has a rather unique perspective on the future of human beings. His most recent biographer believes that Musk is on a mission to develop Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI, a form of AI that is just as cerebrally capable as human beings Mehul Reuben Das Last Updated:September 10, 2023 10:19:07 IST Elon Musk has a rather unique perspective on the future of human beings. His most recent biographer believes that Musk is on a mission to develop Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI, a form of AI that is just as cerebrally capable as human beings Over the past decade, Elon Musk has made substantial investments in a series of increasingly unconventional enterprises, some of which possess a distinctly dystopian/utopian aspect. First, there is Neuralink, a business that is focused on developing a brain-computer interface or a BCI. Then, there is the more ambitious robotic project named “Optimus” under the Tesla umbrella. Musk has even been a part of OpenAI, the organisation he had invested in as a co-founder, that ultimately was responsible for creating ChatGPT and making AI famous. All in all, Musk has played a pivotal role in nurturing a collection of peculiar, science-fiction-inspired businesses that actively explore the boundaries of technological advancement. Related Articles Elon Musk vs ‘Nanny State’: X Corp sues California for overreaching content moderation law Connecting The World: Elon Musk announces video, audio calling feature for X Walter Isaacson, Musk’s newly appointed biographer, has proposed the notion that many of these enterprises form part of a more comprehensive strategy aimed at bringing in a bold new era of artificial general intelligence. In short, Musk plans to make an AI that is as smart as humans and perhaps has the capability to evolve into something even smarter. In an article recently published in Time, Isaacson contends that most of Musk’s diverse investments in startups and business ventures are components of a broader initiative aimed at catalysing the development of “artificial general intelligence,” which is often commonly referred to as AGI. The idea of AGI, as it is often presented to non-tech people is rather abstract. It essentially suggests the impending arrival of an AI model in the future that is vastly superior to humans. This notion has been the subject of both fascination and nightmares and is often referred to as “the singularity.” This scenario envisions artificial intelligence evolving beyond being merely a programmed tool for human-guided algorithmic processes, aptly likened to “stochastic parrots,” a term recently coined for large language models. Instead, “the singularity” envisions AI as a self-learning, organic intelligence capable of mimicking, or perhaps even surpassing, the innate intelligence possessed by humans. Think of it as AI that is constantly evolving and thinking on its own, without any human input or intervention, as if it has consciousness and is aware of its surroundings. According to one of Isaacson’s interviews with Musk, it appears that Musk believes his various, seemingly unrelated business ventures — such as Neuralink, Tesla’s Optimus project, and the neural network training supercomputer named Dojo — could be strategically aligned to pursue the overarching objective of achieving artificial general intelligence. A key element of this purported grand scheme may be Musk’s recent launch of a new startup, xAI. Isaacson speculates that Musk intends to consolidate many of his other enterprises, including xAI and X, into a single expansive entity, that goes beyond the WeChat-like everything app that Musk wants to build. The result could be a formidable artificial intelligence corporation committed to pushing the boundaries of technology beyond its current confines. However, it’s important to note that numerous critics contend that achieving AGI is a distant goal. While Musk may aspire to be the figure who catalyzes the technological revolution often depicted in science fiction movies — a revolution that, according to numerous cinematic portrayals, might ultimately pose a threat to humanity — the feasibility of such an outcome remains uncertain, whether in the near or distant future.

"After Deleting Own Post, India Great Shares 'One Corrupt Guy' Tweet Again","One of the biggest critics of the Indian team, Venkatesh Prasad , hasn't believed in mincing his words while expressing his opinions on cricketing affairs. Having publicly criticised KL Rahul and a few other cricketers in the past, Prasad took a swipe at the Asian Cricket Council most recently, after the governing body announced an exceptional 'Reserve Day' for the India vs Pakistan Super 4 clash. While Prasad's decision to take a swipe at the Jay Shah-led ACC got fans' attention, a post from him on X (formerly Twitter), triggered an even bigger storm. But, Prasad decided to delete, suggesting the post was being comprehended in an unexpected way. But, the former India pacer then decided to share the post once again, this time with a few alterations. ""It takes one corrupt, arrogant guy to take away the hardwork of an otherwise non-corrupt organisation and spoil the reputation of an entire organisation & the impact isn't just micro but at a macro level. This is true in every field, be it politics,sports, journalism, corporate,"" Prasad's fresh post read.

""It takes one corrupt, arrogant guy to take away the hard work of an organisation that is generally non-corrupt and get a stamp of corruption on the whole leadership, not just on a micro level but at a large level,"" Prasad's deleted tweet read. When an X user had asked Prasad about the reason for deleting his tweet, he said: ""That was a general tweet where I spoke about how one person who is corrupt can undo a lot of good work of his organisation and it can have large-scale implications on a macro level as well in any field.

Warner Shatters Sachin's All-Time Record With Century Against South Africa,"Australian batter David Warner went past legendary Indian batter Sachin Tendulkar to become the opener with the most number of centuries in international cricket. The 36-year-old batter accomplished this milestone against South Africa in the second ODI. In the match, Warner was at his vintage best, smashing 106 runs in just 93 balls, consisting of 12 fours and three sixes. He scored his runs at a strike rate of 113.97. This is Warner's 46th international century, the most by an opener. He has 20 centuries in ODIs, 25 in Tests and one in T20Is. He has gone past Tendulkar, who has scored 45 centuries in international cricket as an opener. All of his centuries as an opener have come in ODIs. Also, David Warner now has levelled with England's Joe Root to have the second-highest number of centuries among active players. Both players have 46 international centuries. At the top is star India batter Virat Kohli, who has a total of 76 international centuries, which is the second-highest number of international centuries overall too. Virat has scored 46 ODI centuries, 29 Test centuries and one T20I century. Also, Warner has gone past Matthew Hayden to become Australia's eighth-highest ODI run-scorer. In 144 ODIs, Warner now has 6,136 runs at an average of 45.11. He has scored 20 centuries and 27 fifties in 142 ODIs, with the best score of 179. Hayden has scored 6,131 runs in 160 ODIs at an average of 44.10, with 10 centuries and 36 fifties. The top run-scorer for Australia in ODIs is former skipper Ricky Ponting, who has scored 13,589 runs at an average of 41.81, with 29 centuries and 82 half-centuries. Coming to the match, South Africa opted to field first. Australia put on an opening partnership of 109 runs between Warner and Head (64 in 36 balls, with nine fours and three sixes). Then knocks from Marnus Labuschagne (124 in 99 balls with 19 fours and one six) and Josh Inglis (50 in 37 balls with seven fours and a six) helped Australia reach 392/8 in 50 overs, which is their third-highest ODI total, with the second-best score being 417/6 against Afghanistan (2015) and 434/4 against South Africa (2006) being their best score. Tabraiz Shamsi (4/61) was the pick of the bowlers for SA. Kagiso Rabada took two wickets while Marco Jansen, Andile Phehlukwayo took a wicket each. Advertisement In the chase of 393, SA got off to a promising start with Quinton de Kock (45 in 30 balls with six fours and two sixes) and skipper Temba Bavuma (46 in 40 balls with four boundaries and three sixes) stitching an 81-run opening stand. After that SA sunk to 119/4. Then a 58-run partnership between Heinrich Klaasen (49 in 36 balls with three fours and three sixes) and David Miller (49 in 52 balls with six fours) and 64-run stand between Miller and Marco Jansen (23) took SA near 250 runs, but they could not provide enough fight and bundled out for 269 in 41.5 overs. Adam Zampa (4/48) was the pick of the bowlers for Australia. Sean Abbott, Nathan Ellis and Aaron Hardie got two wickets each. Labuschagne won the 'Player of the Match' award for his century.

IND vs PAK Hourly Weather Report: Rain Threat Looms Large on Super 4 Clash,"Another India vs Pakistan clash in the Asia Cup 2023 is set to witness a stop-start campaign, with the rain threat looming large in the Super 4 clash. When the two teams squared off for the first time in the tournament, the match had to be abandoned without a ball being bowled in the second innings. However, even if no play is possible on Sunday, the match would not be abandoned, as the Asian Cricket Council has put in place a Reserve Day for the fixture. As far as the weather updates go for the day, rain is predicted since morning. As the day progresses, however, the chances of rain increase. From 10 AM to 2 PM, the chances of rain remain under 50% in Colombo, as per Accuweather. From 3 PM to 7 PM, the chances of rain vary between 49% and 66%. After the 7 PM mark, the chances of rain increase slightly to 69% but do not go beyond that mark, as per the weather website. If the rain gods show mercy, play is likely to be possible in the match. But, the likelihood of a full 100-over contest at the moment, looks grim. What happens if rain washes out the match on Sunday? The Asian Cricket Council on Friday announced that the much-anticipated Indo-Pak clash could resume on Monday if the rain plays spoilsport on Sunday. In an advisory, the ACC had on Friday stated that a reserve day was incorporated for the Asia Cup 2023 Super 4's match between Pakistan and India. ""If adverse weather suspends play during the Pakistan vs India game, the match will continue on 11th September 2023 from the point it was suspended,"" the statement added ""If adverse weather suspends play during the Pakistan vs India game, the match will continue on 11th September 2023 from the point it was suspended. ""In such an eventuality, ticket-holders are advised to hold on to their match tickets which will remain valid and will be utilised for the reserve day,"" the advisory stated. However, the other matches will not have a reserve day though rain is predicted in the Sri Lankan capital through the Super 4s. Advertisement The 'Rain God' had its say when the two teams initially clashed in the Asia Cup, resulting in a washout in their opening fixture at Pallekele on September 2.

"G20 Summit 2023: UK PM Rishi Sunak Announces USD 2 Billion Aid, Biggest Single Funding Commitment to Green Climate Fund","New Delhi, September 10: The UK Prime Minister on the second day of G20 Summit announced the contribution of $2 billion to the Green Climate Fund -- the biggest single funding commitment the UK has made to help the world tackle climate change. In a statement, the British High Commission in India said, ""As a gathering of G20 leaders in India concludes today (Sunday), the Prime Minister has announced the UK’s biggest single financial contribution of $ 2 billion to help the world’s most vulnerable people adapt to and mitigate the impact of climate change."" It said: ""The United Kingdom will contribute £1.62 billion ($2 billion) to the Green Climate Fund (GCF), which was established by 194 countries following the Copenhagen Accord at COP15."" The GCF is the largest global fund dedicated to supporting developing countries to reduce global emissions and helping communities adapt to the effects of climate change, the statement read.

It further said that today’s pledge represents a 12.7 per cent increase on the UK’s previous contribution to the GCF for the period of 2020-2023, which was itself a doubling of our initial funding to establish the fund in 2014. At the G20 Summit the Prime Minister has called on leaders to work together ahead of the COP28 Summit this December to both reduce their countries’ own carbon emissions and support vulnerable economies to deal with the consequences of climate change, the British High Commission said. According to the statement, addressing G20 leaders, the Prime Minister said: ""The UK is stepping up and delivering on our climate commitments, both by decarbonising our own economy and supporting the world’s most vulnerable to deal with the impact of climate change.""

""This is the kind of leadership that the world rightly expects from G20 countries. And this government will continue to lead by example in making the UK, and the world, more prosperous and secure,"" PM Sunak said. He also said that the UK has led international efforts to help developing countries tackle climate change, including by pledging to spend £11.6 billion on international climate finance between 2021 and 2026. ""Today’s announcement marks a major contribution towards this commitment and follows the Prime Minister’s announcement at COP27 that the UK would triple our funding for climate adaptation,"" it said. It also said that since 2011 UK climate aid spending has helped over 95 million people cope with the effects of climate change and reduced or avoided over 68 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. ""This goes hand in hand with the UK’s domestic leadership transitioning to clean forms of energy. The UK has cut emissions faster than any other G7 country, with low carbon sources now accounting for more than half of our electricity,"" the statement read. ""We saw renewables generate a record 47.84 per cent of UK electricity in the first three months of 2023 and output from wind, solar and hydro reached a record high last year. Last year, we saw the biggest increase ever in the installation of offshore wind capacity, with the UK home to the four largest working wind farms in the world. ""Alongside this uplift in the UK’s contribution to the GCF, which is expected to again make us one of the largest donors to the fund, the UK Government will continue to stress the importance of the GCF delivering results with even greater speed, demonstrating value for money in all of its activities. This includes asking the GCF to further improve its delivery for those countries most vulnerable to climate change, particularly Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States,"" it added. Earlier in the day, PM Sunak visited the Akshardham temple along with his wife Akshata Murthy and then also visited Rajghat and paid homage to Mahatma Gandhi. The world leaders observed one minute of silence and laid a wreath at Rajghat. On Sunday, the world leaders will discuss 'One Future'.

"Elon is 'rude, mean' but his superpowers helped OpenAI, says Sam Altman on Musk's exit","Tech Elon is 'rude, mean' but his superpowers helped OpenAI, says Sam Altman on Musk's exit Sam Altman has had a close working relationship with Elon Musk, who had invested in Altman's OpenAI as a co-founder. Altman called the Tesla CEO a jerk, but also acknowledged that Musk's charisma and 'superpowers' helped OpenAI a lot in its initial days Mehul Reuben Das Last Updated:September 10, 2023 13:10:58 IST Sam Altman has had a close working relationship with Elon Musk, who had invested in Altman's OpenAI as a co-founder. Altman called the Tesla CEO a jerk, but also acknowledged that Musk's charisma and 'superpowers' helped OpenAI a lot in its initial days When OpenAI introduced ChatGPT in November 2022, it practically introduced the world to what AI can actually do. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, and its CEO, Sam Altman, gained widespread recognition thanks to the chatbot’s soaring popularity. It made Sam Altman the poster boy for generative AI. Over time, details about the company and its CEO began to surface, revealing Elon Musk had also been involved in the founding of OpenAI a few years prior. However, Musk departed in 2018, well before its groundbreaking success with the revolutionary AI chatbot. In recent months, Musk and Altman have engaged in public exchanges of the differing opinions that both of them have held since 2018. Musk has repeatedly expressed concerns about ChatGPT, while Altman, speaking at an MIT event in April, remarked that the letter signed by Musk and other tech experts calling for a pause on AI development “lacked technical nuance about where we need the pause.” Related Articles Professional AI: OpenAI launches ChatGPT Enterprise, a special chatbot for businesses OpenAI to generate over $1 bn in revenue this year, dispels fear of going bankrupt Nevertheless, Altman has now acknowledged Elon Musk’s exceptional qualities and contributions during OpenAI’s early days. Altman on Musk’s “superpowers” During a recent appearance on the In Good Company podcast, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman shed light on Elon Musk’s early contributions to the organization. Altman stated, “Elon was definitely a magnet for talent and attention, without a doubt, and he also possesses some remarkable abilities that were incredibly valuable to us during our initial stages.” While Altman didn’t specify these “superpowers,” venture capitalist Marc Andreessen recently outlined the psychological traits that make Musk “the paramount example” of an entrepreneur who is always in high gear. Musk going against OpenAI Elon Musk’s dissatisfaction with OpenAI became increasingly evident earlier this year as the company’s value surged following the launch of ChatGPT, which rapidly became one of the most widely adopted products in history. In February, Musk expressed his concerns on Twitter, stating, “OpenAI was created as an open source (which is why I named it ‘Open’ AI), non-profit company to serve as a counterweight to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft.” Sam Altman, while acknowledging that OpenAI has taken an unconventional path in many respects, disputes this characterization of the partnership with Microsoft. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has also shared a similar viewpoint. However, in a May interview with CNBC, Musk articulated his concerns by saying, “I do worry that Microsoft actually may be more in control than say the leadership team at OpenAI realizes.” ‘Musk is a jerk’ says Sam Altman Sam Altman’s comments about Elon Musk have been somewhat varied. In May, Altman mentioned during a speech in London that learning from Musk about what is achievable had been extremely beneficial, describing it as “super valuable.” However, during an appearance on the On With Kara Swisher podcast in March, Altman expressed a less flattering view, stating, “I mean, he’s a jerk, whatever else you want to say about him—he has a style that is not a style that I’d want to have for myself.” Published on: September 10, 2023 13:07:39 IST TAGS: Chatgpt Elon Musk Openai Sam Altman",technology
"Something weird is happening with asteroid that NASA hit last year, but WHAT?","Tech Something weird is happening with asteroid that NASA hit last year, but WHAT? Last year, NASA crashed a satellite into Dimorphos, an asteroid millions of miles away from us, in order to change its course. Almost a year after the crash, astronomers are observing some very weird behaviour, that could have massive repercussions Mehul Reuben Das Last Updated:September 10, 2023 13:02:07 IST Last year, NASA crashed a satellite into Dimorphos, an asteroid millions of miles away from us, in order to change its course. Almost a year after the crash, astronomers are observing some very weird behaviour, that could have massive repercussions Almost a year ago, NASA accomplished a groundbreaking feat by successfully redirecting an asteroid, marking a significant step in our ability to avert a potential asteroid crashing into the Earth. However, there’s an intriguing twist to this story, as the asteroid in question appears to be behaving unexpectedly. Change in course As reported by New Scientist, a schoolteacher and his students have noticed peculiar behaviour in the orbit of Dimorphos, the asteroid that NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) impacted last September. Related Articles 'Once in a Blue Moon': Here's how you can witness the rare celestial event today Luna 25 Crash: NASA’s Lunar Orbiter finds possible site where Russia’s lander-rover went down Jonathan Swift, a math and science teacher at the Thacher School in California, and his team of student astronomers made the discovery. Dimorphos orbits the larger near-Earth asteroid Didymos, akin to how our Moon orbits Earth, and it has been consistently slowing down in its orbit around Didymos since the DART test. Mission successful, but to what end? It’s crucial to note that altering Dimorphos’ trajectory was the primary goal of the DART test. NASA had confirmed shortly after the collision last fall that the mission achieved its objective, reducing the asteroid’s orbit duration from 11 hours and 55 minutes to 11 hours and 23 minutes. This was well within the parameters of NASA’s “minimum successful orbit period change” of 73 seconds, affirming the success of the DART test in demonstrating our capability to divert near-Earth asteroids. However, when Swift and his team observed Dimorphos’ orbit more than a month after the collision, they found that the asteroid’s orbit continued to slow down, which was an unexpected development. Most astronomers had anticipated that it would revert to its original orbit speed relatively quickly. Too good to be true? Swift explained, “The number we got was slightly larger, a change of 34 minutes. That was inconsistent at an uncomfortable level.” Although NASA had mentioned a margin of error of plus or minus two minutes in its initial post-DART findings regarding the orbit slowing, this change is still a surprising outcome. Some theories suggest that the impact might have altered Dimorphos’ orbit or released it from the gravitational forces of Didymos. Despite their efforts to scrutinize their findings, Swift and his team were unable to identify any errors in their calculations. NASA is also planning to release a report on the latest developments of the DART mission, as confirmed by a spokesperson. However, they will be competing with Swift and his students, who have shared their findings with the American Astronomical Society, which is set to publish their paper in the near future.

Thick Skin and a Robot: Spanish scientists working on giving humanoid bots skin made of fungus,"Tech Thick Skin and a Robot: Spanish scientists working on giving humanoid bots skin made of fungus A team of researchers in Spain are working to give robots artificial skin made of fungus. The idea is that the skin will not only act as a protective layer but also a multifunctional sensor coating Mehul Reuben Das Last Updated:September 10, 2023 11:53:56 IST A team of researchers in Spain are working to give robots artificial skin made of fungus. The idea is that the skin will not only act as a protective layer but also a multifunctional sensor coating Two researchers have crafted a living fungal skin, inspired directly by a scene from the 1984 film “The Terminator.” Their aim is to develop a biodegradable and multifunctional sensor coating for electronics, as reported by New Scientist. Traditional electronic sensors constructed from silicone often pose manufacturing challenges and limitations when it comes to detecting multiple variables simultaneously. Antoni Gandia, a co-author of an upcoming paper currently under review and affiliated with the Polytechnic University of Valencia in Spain, referenced a particular scene from “The Terminator” in explaining their inspiration. Related Articles What we know about Vyommitra, the female humanoid that ISRO is sending on the Gaganyaan mission Gamifying War: US Army plans to mount assault rifles, LMGs on AI-enabled robot dogs He noted, “There’s this scene in ‘The Terminator’ in which they implant the skin on the robot. The skin is external to him, yet it reports data to the robot and auto-repairs. We wanted to show that we can already do things like that.” The researchers, Antoni Gandia and his colleague Andrew Adamatzky from the University of the West of England, utilized a fungus species known as Ganoderma sessile, which can thrive in diverse environments. They applied agar to encourage the fungus’s growth on a seven-inch model inspired by “The Terminator.” Remarkably, the fungus enveloped the figurine entirely within just five days while also demonstrating sensitivity to light and touch. In their paper, the researchers refer to it as “living, self-regenerating, and reactive Ganoderma sessile mycelium,” effectively transforming a “model cyborg figurine” into a “bio-cybernetic entity.” At its best, this project serves as a proof of concept, and at its most conservative interpretation, it might be seen as a playful experiment. However, the scientists envision that their research could serve as a foundation for the development of living skins that could potentially coat structures to regulate their temperature. In concluding their paper, they assert, “As we continue to push the boundaries of what is achievable with mycelium, we step closer to a future where bio-cybernetic systems are a part of our everyday lives.” Published on: September 10, 2023 11:53:56 IST TAGS: Artificial Skin Humanoid Robots Robotics",technology

However, rain played spoilsport and the match was called off without Pakistan facing a single ball. Another player of the academy mentioned Pakistan having a strong bowling attack but he expressed his confidence in the Indian team. ""Pakistan is a good team and we can't ignore them...with Shaheen Afridi and other Pakistani bowlers in form, their bowling attack is really strong...we are hoping for aggressive cricket from Indian players... players like Virender Sehwag , Gautam Gambhir and Dhoni used to play attacking cricket from the very first ball, we hope that our top order plays in a similar manner today..."" he said.

""I welcome the statement that was released today by the United States, India, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and the European Union, as well as France, Italy and Germany,"" Netanyahu said. ""A good week to you, citizens of Israel. This evening, I am pleased to inform you (of) some major news,"" the Israeli Prime Minister said. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); His message came as hundreds of thousands of Israelis protested on the streets against the government's judicial overhaul plan they think will undermine the authority of the judiciary. ""Israel is at the focus of an unprecedented international project that will link infrastructure from Asia to Europe. This link will also realise a multi-year vision that will change the face of the Middle East, and Israel, and will affect the entire world,"" he said. ""This vision starts in India, passes through the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Israel before reaching Europe,"" Netanyahu said. The announcement of the ambitious project comes amid discussions around the normalisation of ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia. The two countries do not have diplomatic relations but the Gulf kingdom has been seen to be recently softening its position towards Israel by allowing Israeli airlines to use its air space. It is said to have also demanded, as per media reports, several concessions from the United States for the normalisation of ties to happen with the Jewish state, some very contentious ones. ""They announced the launch of a pioneering initiative to develop an economic corridor from India, through the Middle East, to Europe. I am pleased to inform you, citizens of Israel, that our country, the State of Israel, will be a central junction in this economic corridor,"" Netanyahu said. ""Our railways and ports will open a new gateway from India, through the Middle East, to Europe, and back – from Europe to India via Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE,"" the Israeli Prime Minister, battling a downturn in the economy in the face of his controversial Judicial overhaul plans, said.

Several months ago, the US contacted us regarding the realisation of this historic opportunity. Since then, it has held urgent diplomatic contacts in order to bring about today's breakthrough,"" he stressed. The project reshapes the face of our region and allows a dream to become reality, he said. The initiative includes the construction of railways, the laying of a hydrogen pipeline, the energy of the future, the laying of fibre optic communications cables, the laying of electricity cables and more infrastructure, the Israeli Prime Minister noted. ""The State of Israel will contribute its capabilities, all of its experience, momentum and commitment, to realise the largest cooperation project in our history. All government ministries will be instructed to join in realizing this dream,"" he emphasised. ""I have directed the National Security Council, in the Prime Minister's Office, to coordinate the staff work and also the close cooperation with the US and other countries in order for this vision to become reality as soon as possible,"" Netanyahu said. The project will lead us to a new, unique and unprecedented era of global and regional cooperation and involvement. ""Together we will succeed,"" Netanyahu asserted. With protesters turning up in hundreds of thousands every weekend for the last 36 weeks, Israel faces threats of mass emigration, resignations in critical positions, army desertions, strikes and flight of capital backed by gloomy predictions from prestigious global credit rating agencies. Netanyahu has been struggling to show that everything is under control and the economy is stable amid widespread angry protests. He also hinted at the major link project during his trip to Greece and Cyprus early this week to boost the morale of his citizens and supporters.

Elon Musk's Biography Reveals His 'Secret Third Child' With Musician Grimes,"An upcoming biography of Elon Musk has revealed that the Tesla CEO has a 'secret third child' with musician Grimes. The child, named 'Techno Mechanius', but known as Tau, marks Musk's 10th child with three different women. The age of the boy remains undisclosed. The 52-year-old Musk had an on-and-off relationship with the 35-year-old Canadian electro music artist, originally Claire Boucher, between 2018 and 2022. The author of the upcoming biography titled ""Elon Musk"", Walter Isaacson, revealed the existence of this child, according to a New York Times review. Their first child, a boy named X Æ A-Xii (referred to as 'X'), was born in 2020, and they welcomed a girl named Exa Dark Sideræl Musk (nicknamed Y) in March. The couple reportedly separated the previous year. According to the NYT review of Isaacson's book, ""Musk is a mercurial man-child"". The author says that Musk was relentlessly bullied as a kid in South Africa ""until he grew big enough to beat up his bullies"". Excerpts from Isaacson's biography have disclosed several surprising revelations about Musk's personal life and his involvement in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In one excerpt obtained by US-based media website CNN, it was disclosed that Musk had directed SpaceX engineers to disrupt Ukrainian access to Starlink satellites near the Crimean coast to prevent a potential drone attack on Russian warships. The drones, which were loaded with explosives, lost connectivity and posed no threat when they washed ashore during the thwarted attack last year. Musk's concern was that such an attack on occupied Crimea could lead to a ""mini-Pearl Harbor."" Musk later responded to the incident, stating that the Starlink regions in question had not been activated, and SpaceX had not deactivated anything. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); ""Musk was impressed with the design of the submarine drones but that he wouldn’t turn satellite coverage back on for Crimea because Ukraine 'is now going too far and inviting strategic defeat',” the CNN report read. On September 6, Isaacson posted the first images of Musk with Shivon Zilis, the Neuralink executive with whom he had twins in November 2021, along with their two children. This photo prompted Grimes to accuse Musk of not allowing her to see their son 'X', as she posted in a now-deleted message on a social media platform. Grimes wrote, ""Tell Shivon to unblock me and tell Elon to let me see my son or plz [ sic ] respond to my lawyer. I have never even been allowed to see a photo of these children until this moment, despite the situation utterly ripping my family apart."" The biography is the result of two years of shadowing Musk by author Walter Isaacson, who attended Musk's meetings, visited his factories, and conducted extensive interviews with him, his family, friends, colleagues, and adversaries. The book aims to provide a revealing inside story that explores the complex aspects of Musk's life and addresses the question of whether the same demons that drive him are also the driving force behind innovation and progress. It is set to be released on September 12.",world

iPhone 15 Pro rumored to be thicker and lighter than the iPhone 14 Pro,"The window for iPhone 15 rumors is only open for a few more days – these devices are almost certainly getting unveiled on Tuesday – but leaked information keeps on coming. The latest prediction to come our way concerns iPhone 15 weights and dimensions. According to MacRumors sources, the iPhone 15 Pro is going to be both thicker and lighter than the iPhone 14 Pro that came before it. That reduction in weight is down to the previously reported switch from a stainless steel chassis to a titanium one, and matches up with earlier rumors that these phones would be lighter. The iPhone 15 Pro will measure 146.6mm x 70.6mm x 8.25mm and weigh 188 grams, as per MacRumors. That compares to 147.5mm x 71.5mm x 7.85mm and 206 grams for the iPhone 14 Pro that you can currently buy from Apple . It's a similar story for the iPhone 15 Pro Max , apparently. The thickness is said to be increasing from 7.85mm to 8.25mm, while the weight of the phone is dropping from 240 grams to 221 grams thanks to the switch to titanium. When it comes to the iPhone 15 and the iPhone 15 Plus , MacRumors says that the dimensions and weights should be very similar to the previous models, with only minor differences. Here, aluminum is being used again for the phone casing. One other point to note: the report mentions that these predictions are based on pre-production information, and that Apple may have subsequently changed a few aspects of the design before it was finalized. We even get a specific mention of the titanium being used: it's said to be Grade 5 Titanium or Ti-6Al-4V, known for its ""excellent corrosion resistance"". These Pro models could be the toughest and longest-lasting iPhones put out by Apple yet. All should be revealed on Tuesday when Apple has scheduled a special event in the calendar. As well as four iPhone models, we should also be seeing the Apple Watch 9 and quite possibly the Apple Watch Ultra 2 as well.",technology
"WATCH: Pakistan's Babar Azam Take HORRIBLE Review Against India, Gets Brutally Trolled Online After Shocking DRS","India captain Rohit Sharma missed out the chance to complete 13,000 ODI runs vs Pakistan in the Super 4 clash of Asia Cup 2023 at R Premadasa stadium. This was a good time to strike a hundred and reach the milestone but he got dismissed in the 17th over of the match for 56 made off 49 balls. His knock included 6 fours and 4 sixes respectively. Pakistan bowlers had a tough time against him before Shadab Khan dismissed Rohit. The desperation to see the back of Rohit was so much that Pakistan ended up taking one of the worst reviews of all times. In the 4th over of the match bowled by Naseem Shah, the ball was way outside the off stump. Rohit attempted to hit it over the covers but got beaten by the away swing. Mohammd Rizwan collected the ball behind after which there was a huge appeal made by Pakistanis for caught behind. The late swing of the ball made it look like a wicket. Babar Azam and co felt that the ball took the outside edge to the keeper. The on-field Umpire turned it down. But Babar was made to believe that it was indeed out and without wasting any time, he took the review. What followed was an embarrassing moment for Babar and rest of the Pakistani team as the replay showed that the ball was not even near to Rohit's bat as it passed the batsman. After Pakistan's big DRS blunder was showed on the big screen at the stadium, Rohit had a wry smile on his face. Babar and Pakistan team were trolled on social media following the bad review.

From a USB-C port to a new titanium chassis, and even USB-C AirPods Pro 2, we can expect a lot on unveilings at the event Mehul Reuben Das Last Updated:September 10, 2023 17:02:06 IST Although the iPhone 15 series will be headlining the Apple Wanderlust 2023 event, there's a whole bunch of stuff that has tech enthusiasts excited. From a USB-C port to a new titanium chassis, and even USB-C AirPods Pro 2, we can expect a lot on unveilings at the event Apple, a few days ago, officially announced its upcoming event, scheduled for September 12, 2023, at 1:00 PM ET or 10:30 PM, IST. This event will serve as the platform for unveiling the iPhone 15, as well as introducing new Apple Watch models and more. Apple has named the event “Wonderlust,” and it will be held live from Apple Park in Cupertino, California. As with previous events, Apple is expected to livestream the iPhone 15 showcase on its official website and YouTube channel, allowing a global audience to tune in and witness the product reveals and announcements. iPhone 15 with a USB-C, new dynamic island and more The upcoming iPhone 15 will have a significant change – it will use a USB-C port instead of the usual Lightning connector. This change was expected due to European Union regulations. Related Articles Apple set to face tough challenge from authorities, Huawei in China ahead of iPhone 15 launch Apple will unveil the iPhone 15 series on Sept 12, but here’s when people can actually buy them The Pro and Pro Max versions of the iPhone 15 are likely to have faster data transfer through USB 3.2 or Thunderbolt 3, while the base iPhone 15 and 15 Plus are likely to have a USB 2.0. All iPhone 15 models will have quicker 35W charging. The premium models may also feature a faster A17 chip manufactured using the 3nm process, while the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus will likely have the A16 chip from the iPhone 14 Pro. The iPhone 15 series will also feature the Dynamic Island. However, rumours suggest that the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus will have the Dynamic Island as we know it today. The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max variants will be different from the current design. Additionally, they will include an ultra-wideband chip. The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are expected to bring some noteworthy changes. These include a titanium frame, thinner bezels, and a more easily repairable aluminium chassis, similar to what we saw in the iPhone 14. Additionally, both the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max may introduce an action button, similar to the one found on the Apple Watch Ultra. This button could replace the mute toggle and allow users to assign shortcuts to different apps and utilities. Although early rumours suggested that Apple might replace the volume rocker and power button with solid-state toggles, recent reports indicate that these buttons will remain unchanged for now. Leaked photos and videos of upcoming iPhone 15 Pro cases offer a glimpse of what the action button may look like. Apple Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 bring many updates Alongside the iPhone 15, Apple is set to unveil its latest smartwatch lineup, and while major changes aren’t expected, there are some notable updates in store. The premium Apple Watch Ultra is anticipated to retain its 49mm size but come with a new darker titanium case. Additionally, the Watch Series 9 is likely to feature an updated S9 processor. This S9 chip is reportedly based on the A15 processor introduced with the iPhone 13, potentially offering improved efficiency and better battery life compared to its predecessor, which uses the S8 chip based on previous-generation technology. Mark Gurman also predicts that the Apple Watch lineup may incorporate an ultra-wideband chip and various sensor and internal component upgrades, including an updated optical heart rate sensor. Other minor updates expected for the Watch Series 9 include a pink colour option and the availability of a band with a magnetic buckle. It’s unlikely that a new Watch SE will be introduced during this year’s event, as the product appears to follow a two-year refresh cycle and was updated just last year. USB-C AirPods Pro In addition to the iPhone 15, Apple is anticipated to introduce a pair of AirPods Pro with a USB-C-equipped charging case during its September event. This aligns with predictions made by Kuo last year, indicating that Apple plans to release AirPods with a USB-C charging case in 2023. However, it remains uncertain whether Apple will make any substantial updates to the AirPods Pro themselves or if the focus will solely be on updating the charging case. New OS – iOS 17, iPadOS 17, macOS Sonoma During Apple’s upcoming event, we can expect to learn the release dates for iOS 17 and watchOS 10. However, iPadOS 17 and macOS Sonoma may not be unveiled until later in the fall, likely in October, following Apple’s recent release pattern. While the betas for these operating systems have been available for some time, they provide insights into what we can anticipate. iOS 17 brings several small but meaningful enhancements, such as StandBy mode, voicemail transcriptions, and a Journal app. MacOS Sonoma introduces widgets, a game mode, and Safari profiles. In the case of iPadOS 17, Apple is introducing personalized lock screens, interactive widgets, the Health app, and support for external USB webcams and cameras. Additionally, an update to Stage Manager allows customization of window sizes and orientations. Lastly, watchOS 10 will incorporate widgets for quick app access, topographic mapping features, mood logging, and new watch faces. These updates reflect Apple’s ongoing efforts to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem.

The promoter group in stock exchange filings said it has increased stake in flagship to 71.93% from 69.87%. The shares were bought by Kempas Trade and Investment Ltd and Infinite Trade and Investment Ltd This is the second time in less than a month that the promoters have raised stake in the flagship firm. The promoters had last month increased stake in Adani Enterprises Ltd from 67.65% to 69.87%. Both are promoter group firms. In a separate stock exchange filing, the promoter group informed that it has also increased stake in and Ltd from 63.06% to 65.23%. Resurgent Trade and Investment Ltd bought almost 1% stake in Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd in open market transactions and another 1.2% was purchased by Investment DMCC. Both are promoter group firms. The stock exchange filings said the stakes were bought in open market transactions between August 14 and September8. The move comes within weeks of the US-based boutique investment firm GQG Partners buying shares in Adani group firms.

The US short-seller Hindenburg Research, in a report released on January 24, alleged accounting fraud, stock price manipulation and improper use of tax havens at the Adani group, triggering a stock market rout that had erased about $150 billion in the market value at its lowest point. Adani Group has denied all allegations by Hindenburg and is working on a comeback strategy that includes recasting its ambitions, scrapping acquisitions, pre-paying debt to address concerns about its cash flows and borrowings, and scaling back its pace of spending on new projects. GQG has, however, shrugged off the allegations and has since May invested in Adani firms. GQG had previously picked up a 5.4% stake in Adani Enterprises, a 6.54% stake in Ltd and a 2.5% stake in Ltd. GQG has so far invested 38,700 crore in Adani Group firms.

"In A First, Vatican Beatifies Polish Ulma Family Of 9 Executed By Nazis For Helping Jews During WWII","The Vatican on Sunday beatified a Polish family of nine, including a married couple and their young children, who were executed by the Nazis during World War II for providing shelter to Jews. The beatification ceremony took place during a solemn Mass in the Polish village of Markowa, with Cardinal Marcello Semeraro, the papal envoy, reading the Latin formula for beatification, which Pope Francis signed last month. A contemporary painting depicting Jozef and a pregnant Wiktoria Ulma with their children was unveiled near the altar, marking the first instance of an entire family being beatified. Relics from their grave were brought to the altar during the ceremony. Today in Markowa, Poland, the martyrs Józef and Wiktoria Ulma, with their 7 children, were beatified: an entire family exterminated by the Nazis on 24 March 1944 for having given shelter to some persecuted Jews. — Pope Francis (@Pontifex) September 10, 2023 googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); Speaking from a window in St. Peter’s Square at the Vatican, Pope Francis praised the Ulma family as a ""ray of light in the darkness"" during the war and urged everyone to emulate their acts of goodness and service to those in need. He invited the crowd to applaud the family, emphasising their exceptional courage, news agency Associated Press (AP) reported. Last year, Pope Francis declared the deeply Catholic Ulma family, including Wiktoria Ulma's unborn child, as martyrs for their faith, according to the report. They were tragically killed at their home by German Nazi troops and local police under Nazi control in the early hours of March 24, 1944, after what appears to have been a betrayal. Jozef Ulma, 44, was a farmer, Catholic activist, and amateur photographer who documented family and village life. He lived with his 31-year-old wife Wiktoria; their daughters Stanislawa, 7; Barbara, 6; Maria, 18 months; and sons Wladyslaw, 5; Franciszek, 3; and Antoni, 2. Along with them, eight Jews they were hiding in their home, including Saul Goldman and his sons Baruch, Mechel, Joachim, and Mojzesz, as well as Golda Grunfeld and her sister Lea Didner and her young daughter Reszla, were also killed. Lt Eilert Dieken, head of the regional Nazi military police and later a police officer in Germany after the war, gave the orders for the execution. Only one of his subordinates, Josef Kokott, faced prosecution for the killings in Poland and died in prison in 1980. The betrayer is suspected to be Wlodzimierz Les, a member of the Nazi-controlled local police. According to Poland's State Institute of National Remembrance (IPN), he was sentenced to death and executed by the country's wartime resistance in September 1944. According to AP, the Catholic Church faced a theological dilemma in beatifying Wiktoria's unborn child, as it had not been baptized, a requirement for beatification. The Vatican's Dicastery for the Causes of Saints issued a clarification stating that the child was considered ""born"" during the horrific event and thus received ""baptism by blood"" from its martyred mother. Polish President Andrzej Duda, ruling party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, and Poland's chief rabbi, Michael Schudrich, attended the beatification ceremony, joined by thousands of pilgrims from across Poland. The beatification of the #Ulma family - Jozef, Wiktoria and their 7 children, is taking place #OTD in #Markowa . The Ulmas were hiding persecuted Jews in their home for 1.5 years. For this reason, they were killed by the Germans in 1944.

"IND vs PAK: Fakhar Zaman Helps Ground Staff Put Covers During Rain In Colombo, Video Viral","It has been a rain-affected Asia Cup 2023 so far already. While India's match against Pakistan in the Group-stage which was scheduled at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium in Kandy was washed out, rain came in even during their ongoing Super Fours fixture at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. While Pakistan won the toss and elected to field first, Indian openers got the team off to a splendid start with each of Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill scoring half-centuries. Rohit eventually departed for 56 off 49 balls, falling to Shadab Khan in the 17th over and bringing an end to a 121-run partnership. In the very next over, Shaheen Shah Afridi removed Gill with a slower delivery. That brought two new batters at the middle Virat Kohli and comeback man KL Rahul who replaced Shreyas Iyer in the Playing 11. The two were looking to get set before eyeing a strong finish as rain came in and covers had to be brought on with India's scoreboard reading 147/2 in 24.1 overs.

NASA finds 'fairy circles' in Australia emitting Hydrogen: Report,"NASA released a picture on Saturday revealing intriguing natural formations known as “fairy circles” in Australia, which were found to be releasing hydrogen gas from their edges. The images were captured by the Operational Land Imager-2 (OLI-2) on Landsat 9 on June 27, 2023, near the town of Moora, located approximately 150 kilometers north of Perth in the country. This has the potential to be a quest for “alternatives to fossil fuels”. The images were captured by the Operational Land Imager-2 (OLI-2) on Landsat 9 on June 27, 2023. (NASA) In the region, clusters of these round depressions can be spotted running along the Darling Fault, which stretches from north to south. Although they are sometimes referred to as salt lakes, these features are several hundred metres in diameter, and the amount of vegetation and water within them changes over time. The image showcases groups of these fairy circles near Moora. In 2021, researchers stumbled upon the presence of hydrogen in the region while conducting soil-gas measurements. They noticed heightened hydrogen concentrations along the perimeter. According to the NASA report , Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) was the first to officially identify these natural hydrogen emissions in the country and establish a connection with the region's geological characteristics. Hydrogen is the simplest and lightest element in the universe and is quite common. However, in Earth's atmosphere, hydrogen molecules (H2) are scarce because they are highly reactive. Typically, hydrogen can be found at very low concentrations, measured in parts per million, in deep drill holes. The process of producing green hydrogen involves using renewable sources to break down water molecules (H2O) into oxygen (O2) and hydrogen (H2) through a process called electrolysis. How can Hydrogen form naturally? Hydrogen can naturally form within the Earth's subsurface through various processes, such as specific interactions between water and rocks and the breakdown of water molecules due to radiation, a phenomenon known as ‘radiolysis’. In the North Perth Basin, the environmental conditions appear to support the production of hydrogen, the NASA report said. According to the researchers, their theory suggests that this hydrogen is generated when water reacts with the iron-rich rocks in the region. Upon examining geophysical data, it is believed that fault zones might serve as vertical channels through which this gas can migrate to the surface. Previous instances of Hydrogen cluster discoveries -In the past, hydrogen reservoirs were often discovered accidentally. For instance, in the late 1980s, well diggers in Mali (African nation) unexpectedly encountered a highly concentrated natural hydrogen deposit. -Currently, the use of satellite imagery has made it easier to identify ‘fairy circles’ that could potentially be investigated as sources of hydrogen seepage. -Various semi-circular to circular surface features containing high concentrations of hydrogen in their soil have also been observed worldwide, spanning from Brazil and Russia to the US state of North Carolina. -According to NASA, experts believe that there are likely numerous undiscovered natural sources of hydrogen waiting to be found, provided the right tools and a willingness to explore exist. What are the advantages of ‘green’ Hydrogen? - Green hydrogen is entirely sustainable and does not release harmful emissions during production or combustion. -Hydrogen is easily stored, making it suitable for use at a later time or for different purposes than its initial production. -Green hydrogen is adaptable and can be converted into electricity or synthetic gas, serving various purposes in commercial, industrial, or transportation sectors. Disadvantages with Hydrogen -Green hydrogen production is expensive due to the higher cost of renewable energy sources needed for electrolysis. -Hydrogen production, especially green hydrogen, consumes more energy compared to other fuels. -Hydrogen is volatile and flammable, demanding rigorous safety measures to prevent leaks and explosions.

We had to deal with that without losing confidence,” Japan head coach Jamie Joseph said. “It doesn’t matter how much you say to the players that Chile are going to come to play today. The support for their team was amazing. They cheered for everything, as the Japanese do, so you really feel they had a whole bunch of people behind them.” A rousing rendition of the national anthem was followed by a spirited start for Chile, the first World Cup debutants since Russia in 2011, and then a dream try in the sixth minute, manufactured with Latin flair and finished off with a dollop of good fortune. Full-back Inaki Ayarza broke through two tackles to set up the opportunity, but captain Martin Sigren looked to have spoilt it when the ball was knocked out of his hand in the tackle. It, however, went backwards and quick thinking fly-half Fernández pounced on the loose ball, dribbling it forward and then diving on it to dot down. A check by the Television Match Official confirmed the try to the delight of the capacity crowd. Chilean euphoria lasted less than 120 seconds as they dropped the ball from the kick off, allowing Japan to score as lock Fakatava showed a fleetness of foot to burst through and sprint away from the defenders for a quick reply. Basic errors betrayed Chile’s naivety and a late tackle from Matias Dittus on fellow prop Koo Ji-won meant a 10-minute spell in the sin bin, during which time Japan went in the lead on the half-hour mark as winger Naikabula stretched over for their second try. Sigren was also cautioned after head contact in a tackle on Kotaro Matsushima and with the numerical advantage Japan were able to maul over on the stroke of half time as Fakatava claimed his second try and stretched the lead to 21-7. But if it was expected the second half would signal the end of the rookies’ resistance, the opposite was true as Escobar burst over for a 48th-minute try to fire up the crowd and cut Japan’s lead to nine points. That was as good as it got for the gutsy Chileans, with Leitch scoring Japan’s fourth try in the 53rd minute, centre Nakamura the next 10 minutes from time and 21-year-old Dearns used all of his two-metre frame to stretch over and score at the end of the game.",sports

Sudan Drone Attack: 40 Killed in Khartoum As Rival Troops Battle Amid Ongoing Conflict,"Cairo, September 10: A drone attack Sunday on an open market south of Sudan's xapital, Khartoum, killed at least 40 people, activists and medical workers said, as the military and a powerful paramilitary group battle for control of the country. At least three dozen others were injured in the attack in Khartoum's May neighborhood, where paramilitary forces battling the military were heavily deployed, according to an activist group known as the Resistance Committees and two health care workers at the Bashair University Hospital, where the casualties were treated. The activist group, which helps organize humanitarian assistance, posted footage on social media showing bodies wrapped in white sheets in an open yard at the hospital. Sudan has been rocked by violence since mid-April, when tensions between the country's military, led by Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, commanded by Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, burst into open fighting. Drone Attack on Myanmar Police Compound Reportedly Kills 5, Including Army Battalion Commander. The RSF blamed the military's air force for Sunday's attack, though it was not immediately possibly to independently verify the claim. Indiscriminate shelling and airstrikes by both factions aren't uncommon in Sudan's war, which has reduced the Greater Khartoum area to a battleground. The conflict has since spread to several parts of the country. In the Greater Khartoum area, which includes the cities of Khartoum, Omdurman and Bahri, RSF troops have commandeered civilian homes and turned them into operational bases. The military responded by bombing residential areas, rights groups and activists say. In the western Darfur region — the scene of a genocidal campaign in the early 2000s — the conflict has morphed into ethnic violence, with the RSF and allied Arab militias attacking ethnic African groups, according to rights groups and the United Nations. The conflict has killed more than 4,000 people, according to August figures from the United Nations. However, the real toll is almost certainly much higher, doctors and activists say.

The number of the internally displaced has nearly doubled since mid-April to reach at least 7.1 million people, according to the U.N. refugee agency.

In a report tabled before a magisterial court here, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has reportedly named the political leaders who were allegedly behind the conspiracy to implicate Chandy in the case. Following the development, Leader of Opposition in the state assembly V D Satheesan demanded that those found by the CBI to have conspired against the late Congress leader be brought to justice. Satheesan, in a statement, said the late Congress stalwart was hunted and his reputation maligned by his political opponents, and that the CBI report saying there was a conspiracy to implicate him in the case is an answer to all those who targeted Chandy. He also alleged that the conspiracy was hatched with an intention to topple the then UDF government in the state. Satheesan said that as Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had ordered the CBI probe, he cannot avoid the responsibility of the conspiracy. Speaking along similar lines, Congress MP K Muraleedharan said the party was waiting for the entire report to be made public and to know the views of the court before which it was tabled. “At the same time the party wants a fair and unbiased investigation into the conspiracy to implicate Oommen Chandy in the case,"" Muraleedharan, the former Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president and the son of legendary Congress leader K Karunakaran, told reporters. It was a conspiracy to topple the then UDF government by making allegations against Chandy, he claimed and further alleged that “there is no doubt that the current Kerala Chief Minister has a role in it"". “The truth behind it needs to come out. For that a proper investigation is required, that is the party’s wish. This issue would also be discussed in the party leadership meeting to be held on September 12. We want those behind the conspiracy to be brought before the public,"" the Congress MP said. Similar demands were made by Congress MLA Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan too. Meanwhile, Saranya Manoj, a close relative of Kerala Congress (B) MLA K B Ganesh Kumar, claimed there was no political conspiracy in the matter and that he was hurt by the “unnecessary"" allegations against Chandy. Both Manoj and Kumar’s names reportedly figure in the CBI report. The Kerala Congress (B) is a part of the ruling LDF. Manoj also told reporters that were no sexual assault related allegations against Chandy in the initial letter of the complainant and that Kumar had no role in the matter. “In fact, Kumar gave statements in favour of Chandy before the CBI. That is what I was told by CBI officials too,"" Manoj claimed. “I do not believe there was a political conspiracy,"" he added. On the other hand, seven-time former MLA P C George alleged that he was approached to give a statement implicating Chandy, but he had refused to do so. He too alleged that Vijayan was behind it as, without his direction, no one would dare to take such steps against Chandy. The CBI in December last year had given a clean chit to Chandy in the sexual exploitation allegation levelled by a woman, who is the prime accused in the sensational solar scam that had rocked the state when his government was in power nearly a decade ago. The CBI had earlier submitted referral reports in the court giving clean chits to four other Congress leaders including AICC general secretary K C Venugopal, Lok Sabha MPs Adoor Prakash and Hibi Eden and MLA A P Anil Kumar who were named as accused in the sexual exploitation case filed by the woman. The cases against the six people, including Chandy, were registered over the past few years and investigated by the Crime Branch of the Kerala Police based on a complaint by the woman, an accused in the multi-crore solar panel scam during the UDF government, that she was sexually exploited by them in 2012. The CPI(M)-led Kerala government had recommended a CBI inquiry into the cases in January 2021, a few months ahead of the polls to the state assembly.",politics
BRS to Celebrate 'National Integration Day' on September 17: Telangana Minister Rama Rao,"The Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) will celebrate ‘National Integration Day’ on September 17, the day the erstwhile Hyderabad State under Nizam rule merged with the Indian Union in 1948, party leader and Telangana Minister K T Rama Rao said on Sunday. BRS working president Rama Rao also asked party cadres to take part in the National Integration Day celebrations in large numbers and celebrate the event in a grand manner across the state, a party release said. BRS President and Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao will take part in the celebrations in Hyderabad, he said. The ministers will take part and hoist the tricolour in the celebrations to be organised by the state government on a grand scale in all the District headquarters, Rama Rao said. “People of Telangana would celebrate September 17 as National Integration Day,"" he said and called upon the party ranks to organise the celebrations in their respective places. In the 10 years since its formation, Telangana has been riding on the twin horses of development and welfare, Rama Rao, also known as KTR said. Telangana has emerged as a role model for other states in the country by undertaking innovative development. Unable to digest this, some political parties have been slinging mud on the government, he said and alleged that they are even conspiring against the celebration of National Integration Day. People should be wary of forces that were seeking to mingle religion into everything and cause a rift in society, Rama Rao said. September 17, the day the then princely state of Hyderabad merged with the Indian Union in 1948, is interpreted differently by different parties in Telangana. The Union Government and different political parties have planned to organise events in Hyderabad to celebrate the day. The BRS government had declared the day last year as National Integration Day. Union Home Minister Amit Shah had participated in the official celebration of the ‘Hyderabad Liberation Day’ held by the Centre in Hyderabad last year and he is expected to attend the event in the Telangana capital this year as well. Describing September 17, 1948 as ‘Liberation Day’, the BJP has been fighting for its official celebration by government for about two decades now. The Congress had earlier said the party will hold a “mega rally"" near Hyderabad on September 17, where it will announce five guarantees for Telangana ahead of the Legislative Assembly elections. The AIMIM Party said it will be organising a bike rally and public meeting on the occasion of ‘National Integration Day’ on September 17. Union Tourism Minister and BJP president in Telangana G Kishan Reddy on Saturday hit out at the Congress and BRS for not officially celebrating September 17 during their tenure in office allegedly under the influence of AIMIM.",politics

Injured Politano and Mancini out of Italy’s clash with Ukraine,"Matteo Politano and Gianluca Mancini will miss Italy’s crucial Euro 2024 qualifying clash against Ukraine with injury, the country’s football federation said on Sunday. In a statement, the FIGC said that Napoli forward Politano and Roma defender Mancini had respectively picked up calf and thigh knocks during Italy’s 1-1 draw with North Macedonia. Coach Luciano Spalletti, who lost attacker Federico Chiesa and midfielder Lorenzo Pellegrini to injury before Saturday’s draw in Skopje, has called up Bologna forward Riccardo Orsolini. Italy sits third in Group C, three points behind Ukraine -- which is second having played a game more -- with the pair facing off at the San Siro in Milan on Tuesday night. It is a key crucial fixture for each side’s hopes of claiming one of two automatic spots for next summer’s tournament in Germany, with leader England nine points ahead of the European champion Spalletti took charge of Italy last month following the shock resignation of Roberto Mancini, who then took over Saudi Arabia’s national team.

"IND vs PAK, Asia Cup 2023 Super Four: Play Called Off In Colombo, Match To Resume On September 11","googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); IND vs PAK, Asia Cup 2023 Super Four: While cricket fans in India were expecting an action-packed Sunday at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, what they did witness was a positive start by the Indian openers after which Pakistan bowlers made in a couple of early inroads after which rain came in and made no further play possible. 24.1 overs of Indian innings was made possible on September 10 (Sunday) and at this point, the Indian scoreboard read 147/2. What that essentially means though that with a reserve day in place for this IND vs PAK fixture, the match will now resume tomorrow at 03:00 pm (IST). The other big news is that no overs will be reduced and it remains a 50-overs per side contest. Having said that, the weathe report in Colombo for the reserve day doens't look too promising either with chances of rain even on Monday (September 11) and so it would be interesting to see what eventually happens in this match. For the unversed, this is the second time an India vs Pakistan match was played in this continental tournament after their group-stage face off at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium in Kandy. However, even in that match rain had played a spoilsport and teams were ultimately forced to share points with only the Indian innings possible as they posted 266 after electing to bat first. There was no reserve day in place for that match. Teams would well be forced to share points in case rain comes back tomorrow. Pakistan have already started off their Super Fours campaign with a win over Bangladesh while this is India's first match in this round of the continental tournament. This match seeping into Reserve Day also means India will now have two matches in two days with India's match against Sri Lanka scheduled on September 12.",sports
Former TN batter P Ramesh marks special Buchi Babu visit during first final in five years,"There was a special visitor to watch Madhya Pradesh and Delhi battle in the final of the Buchi Babu tournament, which has been revived after five years, in Coimbatore on Sunday. P. Ramesh was a former Tamil Nadu and South Zone batter who played 30 First Class matches. More importantly, he is a living symbol of the legacy left behind by a man in whose memory the tournament is being held. The 70-year-old Ramesh is the great-grandson of Buchi Babu Naidu, known as the ‘Father of Madras Cricket’, for having promoted the sport among the local population in the city in the late 19th and early 20th century before his untimely demise in 1908. Speaking to , a visibly pleased Ramesh said, “I am so happy they have revived the tournament. Last year, when I met the TNCA President and Secretary, I requested them to revive the tournament, and they kept the promise. It is a prestigious tournament and offers a good chance for youngsters to play at a higher level of cricket and learn the nuances of the game from the seniors,” he added. Ramesh made a century on his Ranji Trophy debut for TN against Karnataka, facing the likes of Erapalli Prasanna and B. S. Chandrasekhar. He later was a South Zone selector for the Colts team and recalled selecting Rahul Dravid and Anil Kumble for the under-19 team. Ramesh, who will give the trophy on Monday, also said he was pleased with how the tournament has been organised and added that his wish is to see a stand in Chepauk named after his great-grandfather.

Indian Grand Prix-5: Vithya clocks personal best; shocks Himanshi and Aishwarya in women’s 400m,"Tamil Nadu’s Vithya Ramraj shocked Himanshi Malik and Aishwarya Mishra as she won the women’s 400m in a personal best 52.40s at the Indian Grand Prix-5 athletics in Chandigarh on Sunday. The women’s quarter-mile results – the event was run as two races, A and B – should give a big worry to the selectors, regarding the composition of the 4x400m relay team ahead of this month’s Asian Games in Hangzhou. Himanshi, the fastest quarter-miler in the Asiad relay team with her 51.76s at the recent inter-State Nationals in Bhubaneswar, could only finish 15th overall with a shocking 57.59s while Aishwarya was eighth (53.35). The two will also be running the individual 400m at Hangzhou. Prachi (53.01) and Kiran Pahal (53.14), who do not figure in the Asiad relay team cleared by the Sports Ministry recently, finished third and fifth overall today. Vithya also has not been named in the six-member relay team, but since she figures in the Asiad team as a 400m hurdler, she could be used in the relay too. Incidentally, Asian women’s 100m hurdles gold medallist Jyothi Yarraji, who was making her 400m debut, clocked 53.91 while finishing 10th. Meanwhile, Amoj Jacob was the fastest in the men’s 400m, which was run as five races, while Asian Games champion Jinson Johnson clocked a season-best 3:39.32s while taking the men’s 1500m title. Abha Khatau, who is not in the Asiad team, beat the two – Kiran Baliyan (17.92m) and Manpreet Kaur (16.30) – who figure in the squad for Hangzhou with a quality 18.02m effort while winning the women’s shot put.

Top women’s football official Nadine Kessler turns down trailblazing job in Germany to stay with UEFA,"UEFA’s head of women’s football Nadine Kessler has turned down the chance to take a trailblazing job overseeing all of Germany’s national teams, including the men’s, the European football body said Sunday. The former FIFA Women’s Player of the Year had talks over the past month with the German football federation (DFB) in its search for a managing director to replace Olivier Bierhoff. He left in December after another early exit for the national team at the men’s World Cup. Hiring the 35-year-old Kessler would have been a powerful statement by the DFB amid rapid progress for women’s football globally on the field but systemic problems off the field in governance by football bodies. Kessler said she was “flattered to have been approached” by her national federation. “I have decided to step back from the conversations last week and wish to continue my current role wholeheartedly,” the former Germany midfielder said in a statement released by UEFA, which is based in Nyon, Switzerland. Spain’s victory in the Women’s World Cup three weeks ago has been tarnished by the international furor provoked by now-suspended Spain federation president Luis Rubiales. Prosecutors in Spain are now investigating Rubiales for alleged sexual assault against player Jenni Hermoso by kissing her on the lips without consent after the final in Sydney, Australia. Rubiales remains a vice president of UEFA. The Spanish team’s coach, Jorge Vilda, was fired last week almost one year after a rebellion against him by 15 players. The male coach of Slovenia’s women’s team also was . Kessler joined UEFA in 2017, soon after her playing career was ended by knee injuries. “I want to thank UEFA for having encouraged me to look into this opportunity,” Kessler said, “and wish the DFB the very best of luck to find the best possible candidate.” Both of Germany’s senior national teams are going through tough times and men’s team coach . His team lost a third straight game, 4-1 to Japan, on Saturday in its preparation to play as host nation at the 2024 European Championship.

"IND vs PAK, Asia Cup 2023: What happens if play is called off on Reserve Day?","India’s game against Pakistan In the Super 4 stage of the Asia Cup 2023 at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo was called off due to inclement weather. With the addition of a reserve day for the fixture, the game will resume from the exact stage where it stopped on Sunday. India was 147 for the loss of two wickets in the 25th over. The original match day could have been extended by 90 minutes in order for a result. After the first rain break, the ground was almost ready with the umpires just waiting for one patch of the ground to dry. However, around 8:30PM, the heavens opened up again and the play had to be called off. The weather forecast is pretty similar on Monday in Colombo, with chances of thunder showers and precipitation ranging between 40-50%. If the game is called off on Monday as well, the teams will share one point each and the contest will go down as a ‘No Result’. The game will remain a 50-over per side contest when play resumes on Monday. However, had the game been curtailed and restarted today before the second spell of rains arrived, the reserve day would have seen the game remain a shortened one. Comments Related Topics",sports
SAFF U-16 Championships: India beats Bangladesh in final,"India’s U-16 team secured its status as champion of the SAFF U-16 Championship 2023, defeating Bangladesh 2-0 in a high-octane final. Bharat Lairenjam found the net in the first half, while Levis Zangminlun sealed the victory with a second-half goal, ensuring a comfortable win for India. Guided by head coach Ishfaq Ahmed, the Blue Colts had a sparkling run throughout the championship not conceding a single goal throughout the tournament. In the final match against Bangladesh, India displayed tactical prowess and control to secure the win. India’s initial breakthrough came early, just eight minutes into the match. Levis Zangminlun provided an incisive through ball to forward Bharat Lairenjam, who slotted the ball between the legs of Bangladesh goalkeeper Mohammad Nahidul Islam to score. India kept the pressure on in the first half, but failed to score, mostly due to some smart work by Islam. India started the second half with the same intensity. Its relentless search for another goal bore fruit in the 74th minute with a sublime strike. Samson Ahongshangbam initiated a promising move down the left wing before expertly switching play to send the ball to Levis Zangminlun on the opposite flank. Engaging in a swift one-two pass with Vishal Yadav, Zangminlun outmanoeuvred his defender to find himself in open space. Taking a moment to set himself, he then unleashed a devastating left-footed strike that sailed into the back of the net, doubling India’s advantage and sealing the win.

"Nepal Prime Minister consults experts, political leaders ahead of China visit","Listen to Story Nepal's Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' on Sunday held extensive consultations ahead of his official visit to China later this month, a trip aimed at maintaining a balance in ties with both the neighbours - China and India. This will be his second foreign trip after assuming the office in December last year. The 68-year-old Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist Centre (CPN-MC) leader visited India in June as his first foreign trip after assuming office for the third time. During discussions held at the Prime Minister’s Office at Singha Durbar here, the Prime Minister was advised to prioritize the establishment of balanced diplomatic ties with the neighbours, to review the implementation status of past agreements, to pay heed to security affairs of mutual concerns, and to promote Nepal's non-aligned foreign policy, sources said. Those present at the meeting were lawmakers representing various political parties, political leaders, former prime ministers and former foreign ministers, they said. Earlier, Prachanda also held consultations with former foreign secretaries and former ambassadors of Nepal to different countries. During the meeting, the Prime Minister expressed confidence that his upcoming China visit would be productive and the government was making necessary preparations for making the journey successful, according to sources close to the PM. The Prime Minister also made it clear that the government was committed to maintaining balanced relations with Nepal's two close neighbours and all other friendly countries. He reiterated the government's commitment to the policy of non-alignment. According to the Prime Minister, Nepal has set out to highlight its development efforts, the impact of climate change, its efforts to conclude the peace process and other contemporary issues, appealing to the world for combined efforts towards that end. ""The China visit will focus on further strengthening Nepal-China relations and issues of bilateral interests,"" sources said. The experts and political leaders advised the Prime Minister to move forward only deliverable and viable projects during his visit to China. They suggested the Prime Minister to make the visit meaningful by addressing the concerns of China, according to Foreign Minister N.P. Saud. They also advised the Prime Minister to direct his visit towards further consolidating the close relations existing between Nepal and China. Prachanda will leave for an official visit to the US and China on September 16. He will travel to the US first, where he will attend the 78th United Nations General Assembly. After spending five days in the US, Prachanda will fly directly to Beijing. Prachanda's visit to China is a bid by the senior Maoist leader to strike a balance in relations with China and India. China has been actively investing in Nepal in many infrastructure projects.",world
Moscow claims Putin's party wins votes in annexed Ukraine regions,"Russia claimed Sunday that the United Russia party, which staunchly backs President Vladimir Putin, had won local ballots in four Ukrainian regions occupied by Russia. The Kremlin claimed to have annexed the eastern and southern territories last year despite not having full military control over them. The elections have been dismissed by Ukraine and its allies as a sham. Data published by Moscow and proxy officials showed voters in the war-battered territories, where Ukraine is clawing back ground, had backed United Russia with more than 70 percent of the ballot in each territory, state-run news agencies reported. The polls also being held across Russia came ahead of presidential elections next year expected to prolong Putin's rule until at least 2030. His opponents are in exile or jail and Moscow has criminalised criticism of its conflict in Ukraine and detained thousands for speaking out. Authorities set up mobile polling booths days ahead of the vote in the regions of Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia, where Moscow said a polling station was attacked by a Ukrainian drone. In Donetsk, which has been partially controlled by separatists since 2014, Kremlin-installed authorities said Ukrainian shelling had injured election officials. Voting was also taking place in Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014. Ukrainian security services said they had compiled a list of ""collaborators"" helping to organise the voting and vowed retribution. In Rostov-on-Don, a southwest city close to Ukraine's border attacked by drones this week, two voters told AFP the conflict was their main worry. ""We just want to live in peace with our children,"" said 40-year-old Nina Antonova. ""Everyone is worried about this one problem -- the war. We don't have any other concerns,"" said 84-year-old Anatoli, a pensioner who declined to give his last name. In Moscow, which was also hosting a mayoral vote, there were few campaign posters. Incumbant Sergei Sobyanin -- a Siberian-born Kremlin loyalist in post since 2010 -- won a ""convincing"" reelection, a senior election official said. In his 13 years at the helm of Europe's largest city, Sobyanin has presided over numerous mega-projects that have transformed Moscow's skyline. In 2013, he was almost defeated by anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny. Navalny, who dismissed the vote from behind bars, was jailed in 2020 on old fraud charges his allies say were a pretext to end his political work. Sobyanin beat out the grandson of a veteran Communist politician and a little-known candidate from a new party dubbed ""New People"". Moscow residents ahead of the vote had praised Sobyanin for modernising the city. ""Moscow is blossoming in front of our eyes,"" 21-year-old student Rukhin Aliyev told AFP. Musician Kirill Lobanov said Sobyanin had done ""very well"" as mayor, particularly ""in the last year"" marked by the conflict. Sobyanin has downplayed increasing Ukrainian drone attacks on Moscow that have hit the Kremlin and crashed into the capital's iconic financial district. In regions bordering Ukraine that have seen frequent attacks, voting was going ahead with additional security precautions. Electoral commission chief Ella Pamfilova said voting had been postponed in Shebekino, a district of the Belgorod region that has been hit by shelling, ""due to a regime of high alert"". Observers say one of the few competitive races in Russia's 11 time zones emerged in Siberia's remote Khakassia, where governor Valentin Konovalov is seeking re-election. The 35-year-old Communist defeated a Kremlin-backed candidate in 2018 after a wave of rare protests in the sparsely populated mountainous region. In this year's campaign, he initially faced Moscow-backed candidate Sergei Sokol, who portrayed himself as a Kremlin-decorated ""hero"" who fought in Ukraine. Sokol dropped out at the last minute, citing health reasons. Konovalov is one of few regional leaders not backed by the Kremlin who remains in office.",world
Hurricane Lee unleashes heavy swell on northern Caribbean as it charges through open waters,"Hurricane Lee barreled Sunday through open waters just northeast of the Caribbean, unleashing heavy swell on several islands as it restrengthened. The Category 3 storm is not forecast to make landfall and is expected to stay over open waters through Friday. On late Sunday afternoon, it was centered about 285 miles (455 kilometers) north-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands. It had winds of up to 120 mph (195 kph) and it was moving west-northwest at 8 mph (13 kph). Last week, Lee strengthened from a Category 1 storm to a Category 5 storm in just one day. “We had the perfection conditions for a hurricane: warm waters and hardly any wind shear,” said Lee Ingles, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in San Juan. Lee is expected to strengthen further in upcoming days and will then weaken again, according to the National Hurricane Center. Breaking waves of up to 20 feet (6 meters) were forecast for Puerto Rico and nearby islands starting early this week, with authorities warning people to stay out of the water. Coastal flooding also was expected for some areas along Puerto Rico's north coast and the eastern portion of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, according to the National Weather Service in San Juan. The National Hurricane Center noted that dangerous surf and rip currents were expected to hit most of the U.S. East Coast starting Sunday, but that the hurricane's impact beyond that is still unclear. ""It is way too soon to know what level of impacts, if any, Lee might have along the U.S. East Coast, Atlantic Canada, or Bermuda, especially since the hurricane is expected to slow down considerably over the southwestern Atlantic."" the center said. Lee was forecast to take a northward turn by Wednesday. However, its path after that remained unclear. ""Regardless, dangerous surf and rip currents are expected along most of the U.S. East Coast this week as Lee grows in size,"" the center said. Lee is the 12th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30 and peaked on Sunday. Tropical Storm Margot became the 13th named storm after forming Thursday evening, but was far out in the Atlantic and posed no threat to land. It was located about 1,175 miles (1,895 kilometers) west-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands on Sunday. Its winds had risen to 65 mph (100 kph) and it was forecast to strengthen into a hurricane on Monday. It was moving north-northwest at 9 mph (15 kph). The National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration in August forecast between 14 and 21 named storms this season. Six to 11 of them are expected to become hurricanes, and of those, two to five might develop into major hurricanes.

Country singer-songwriter Charlie Robison dies in Texas at 59,"Charlie Robison, the Texas singer-songwriter whose rootsy anthems made the country charts until he was forced to retire after complications from a medical procedure left him unable to sing, died on Sunday. He was 59. Robison died at a hospital in San Antonio after suffering cardiac arrest and other complications, according to a family representative. Robison launched his music career in the late 1980s, playing in local Austin bands like Two Hoots and a Holler before forming his own Millionaire Playboys. In 1996, he released his solo debut, “Bandera,” named for the Texas Hill Country town where his family has had a ranch for generations. When he was approached by Sony in 1998, Robison signed with its Lucky Dog imprint, which was devoted to rawer country. His 2001 album “Step Right Up” produced his only Top 40 country song, “I Want You Bad."" In 2018, Robison announced that he had permanently lost the ability to sing following a surgical procedure on his throat. ""Therefore, with a very heavy heart I am officially retiring from the stage and studio,” he wrote on Facebook. Robison served as a judge for one year on USA Network's “Nashville Star,” a reality TV show in which contestants lived together while competing for a country music recording contract.

'Shaking very foundation of G20': Japanese PM slams Russia's invasion of Ukraine,"Listen to Story Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Sunday said the Russian invasion of Ukraine is ""shaking"" the very foundation of cooperation at the G20 and the declaration of the grouping's summit highlighted the need for respecting the territorial integrity of all states. At a media briefing, Kishida said the G20 leaders' declaration unveiled under India's presidency is a truly meaningful achievement and that all members of the grouping underlined the importance of a ""just and durable"" peace in Ukraine. ""Russia's aggression of Ukraine is shaking the very foundation of cooperation at the G20...Further, it is causing an enormous impact on the world economy through factors such as the protracted rise of food and energy prices,"" he said. ""Today, as the world faces complex crises, collaboration at the G20 as a premier forum for economic cooperation is becoming increasingly important,"" Kishida added. The declaration issued at the G20's Bali summit last November deplored in the strongest terms the Russian aggression against Ukraine, while most members strongly condemned the war. The G20 New Delhi Leaders' Declaration refers only to the ""war in Ukraine"" and noted with ""deep concern the immense human suffering and the adverse impact of wars and conflicts around the world"". In reference to the Ukraine conflict, it also has a line that ""there were different views and assessments of the situation"". Both Russia and China had agreed to the two paragraphs on the Ukraine conflict in the Bali declaration, but they backtracked from it this year creating difficulties for India. In his remarks, Kishida also described India as an ""indispensable partner"" for Japan in its aim to achieve a 'Free and Open Indo-Pacific'. On the Ukraine issue, he said most of the G20 member nations confirmed the need for the bloc to respond to the intensifying impact of the Ukraine crisis on the global economy. To a question on whether the G20 has been gaining prominence as the UN is seen as a dysfunctional body, Kishida said the G20 cannot replace the functions of the UN. ""While the G20 cannot replace the functions of the UN, Japan will continue to deal with the challenges facing the international community through the G20 framework, which we think is playing a very important role, as well as utilising other frameworks,"" he said.",world
"US and Vietnam ink historic partnership in Biden visit, with eyes on China","Listen to Story US President Joe Biden on Sunday secured deals on semiconductors and minerals as the strategic Southeast Asian nation lifted Washington to Hanoi's highest diplomatic status alongside China and Russia. The US has been pushing for the upgrade for months as it sees the manufacturing dynamo as a key country in its strategy to secure global supply chains from China-related risks. A half-century after a lengthy and brutal Cold War-era conflict, Biden arrived in Hanoi to a ceremony organised by the ruling Communist Party that included school children waving American flags and honour guards carrying bayoneted rifles. Biden noted the strides that had been taken toward improved ties. ""We can trace a 50-year arc of progress between our nations, from conflict to normalisation to this new elevated status,"" he said. The partnership with Vietnam is part of the Biden administration's push ""to demonstrate to our Indo-Pacific partners and to the world, the United States is a Pacific nation and we're not going anywhere,"" Biden told reporters after the meeting in Hanoi. Vietnam is navigating frosty relations between Washington and Beijing as the tech and textile exporter seeks its own foothold in the international competition to be a low-cost manufacturing hub. Top Chinese officials, possibly including President Xi Jinping, are expected to visit Vietnam in the coming days or weeks, officials and diplomats said, as Hanoi seeks to maintain good relations with all superpowers. Biden also said in Hanoi he had talked with Xi's deputy at the G20, and that the two talked about stability. Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, 79, remarked on the 80-year-old US president's appearance inside party headquarters, saying ""You have nary aged a day and I would say you look even better than before."" Vietnam's longstanding relationship with Russia faces tests over the war in Ukraine, including talks with Moscow over a new arms supply deal that could trigger US sanctions. Reuters has seen documents describing talks for a credit facility that Russia would extend to Vietnam to buy heavy weaponry, including anti-ship missiles, antisubmarine aircraft and helicopters, antiaircraft missile systems and fighter jets. One of them, a letter sent in May by Vietnam's Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh to the Russian government, showed interest in a possible new deal. A Vietnamese military officer confirmed the authenticity of the letter and the talks for a new $8 billion credit facility to buy heavy weaponry. A spokesperson for Vietnam's foreign ministry did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the documents, which show Moscow pushing for months for a loan deal that would bypass Western sanctions on Moscow. Hanoi is in similar talks with multiple arms suppliers, including the United States. In recent weeks, Vietnam has engaged in several high-level defence meetings with top Russian officials. The US-Vietnam upgrade will include a security dimension, Jon Finer, the US principal deputy national security adviser, told reporters on Sunday, while on the plane with Biden to Vietnam from a Group of 20 summit in India. He said he had no arms deals to announce at this stage but stressed that the US and its partners could offer Vietnam help to diversify away from Russian military supplies, an offer which he said Vietnam was receptive to. That would help Vietnam reduce military reliance on Moscow, ""a relationship we think they are increasingly uncomfortable with,"" Finer said. Biden's visit comes as bilateral trade and investment ties are growing and a long-simmering territorial dispute between Vietnam and China heats up in the South China Sea. Vietnam Airlines is expected to sign an initial agreement to buy about 50 Boeing 737 Max jets in a deal valued at $10 billion, timed to the trip. Highlighting Vietnam's growing importance as a ""friend-shoring"" destination for US technology companies, executives from Google, Intel, Amkor, Marvell, GlobalFoundries and Boeing are expected to meet on Monday with Vietnamese tech executives and Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Hanoi. Still, semiconductors are the centrepiece of an action plan adopted during Biden's visit, US officials said. Besides possible announcements by US corporations, it is unclear what else the partnership could mean. The US government has $100 million a year for five years available under the CHIPS Act to support semiconductor supply chains globally. A large part of it could go to Vietnam, officials said. More support to train skilled workers is also part of the deal, as Vietnam faces a major shortage of engineers in the chips sector. Another key issue is strengthening supply chains of critical minerals, especially rare earths, of which Vietnam has the world's largest deposits after China, according to US estimates, officials said. Two people familiar with the plans said an agreement on rare earths was expected during Biden's visit, which ends on Monday when he flies back to America. Details, however, are scant. Past attempts by US companies to partner with Vietnamese rare earth firms have not succeeded, according to a person involved in one recent plan. Human rights remain a controversial issue, with US officials regularly criticising Hanoi for jailing activists and limiting freedom of expression. Vietnam may show goodwill, with diplomats suggesting activists could be freed.",world
Russia Says Party Backing Putin Wins Polls In 4 Areas Occupied In Ukraine,"Voting was also taking place in Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014. (Representational) Russia claimed Sunday that the United Russia party, which staunchly backs President Vladimir Putin, had won local ballots in four Ukrainian regions occupied by Russia. The Kremlin claimed to have annexed the eastern and southern territories last year despite not having full military control over them. The elections have been dismissed by Ukraine and its allies as a sham. Data published by Moscow and proxy officials showed voters in the war-battered territories, where Ukraine is clawing background, had backed United Russia with more than 70 per cent of the ballot in each territory, state-run news agencies reported. The polls also being held across Russia came ahead of presidential elections next year expected to prolong Putin's rule until at least 2030. His opponents are in exile or jail and Moscow has criminalised criticism of its conflict in Ukraine and detained thousands for speaking out. Authorities set up mobile polling booths days ahead of the vote in the regions of Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia, where Moscow said a polling station was attacked by a Ukrainian drone. In Donetsk, which has been partially controlled by separatists since 2014, Kremlin-installed authorities said Ukrainian shelling had injured election officials. Voting was also taking place in Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014. Ukrainian security services said they had compiled a list of ""collaborators"" helping to organise the voting and vowed retribution. - 'Live in peace' - In Rostov-on-Don, a southwest city close to Ukraine's border attacked by drones this week, two voters told AFP the conflict was their main worry. ""We just want to live in peace with our children,"" said 40-year-old Nina Antonova. ""Everyone is worried about this one problem -- the war. We don't have any other concerns,"" said 84-year-old Anatoli, a pensioner who declined to give his last name. In Moscow, which was also hosting a mayoral vote, there were few campaign posters. Incumbant Sergei Sobyanin -- a Siberian-born Kremlin loyalist in post since 2010 -- won a ""convincing"" reelection, a senior election official said. In his 13 years at the helm of Europe's largest city, Sobyanin has presided over numerous mega-projects that have transformed Moscow's skyline. In 2013, he was almost defeated by anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny. Navalny, who dismissed the vote from behind bars, was jailed in 2020 on old fraud charges his allies say were a pretext to end his political work. Sobyanin beat out the grandson of a veteran Communist politician and a little-known candidate from a new party dubbed ""New People"". Moscow residents ahead of the vote had praised Sobyanin for modernising the city. ""Moscow is blossoming in front of our eyes,"" 21-year-old student Rukhin Aliyev told AFP. Musician Kirill Lobanov said Sobyanin had done ""very well"" as mayor, particularly ""in the last year"" marked by the conflict. Sobyanin has downplayed increasing Ukrainian drone attacks on Moscow that have hit the Kremlin and crashed into the capital's iconic financial district. - 'High alert' - In regions bordering Ukraine that have seen frequent attacks, voting was going ahead with additional security precautions. Electoral commission chief Ella Pamfilova said voting had been postponed in Shebekino, a district of the Belgorod region that has been hit by shelling, ""due to a regime of high alert"". Observers say one of the few competitive races in Russia's 11 time zones emerged in Siberia's remote Khakassia, where governor Valentin Konovalov is seeking re-election. The 35-year-old Communist defeated a Kremlin-backed candidate in 2018 after a wave of rare protests in the sparsely populated mountainous region. In this year's campaign, he initially faced Moscow-backed candidate Sergei Sokol, who portrayed himself as a Kremlin-decorated ""hero"" who fought in Ukraine. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com Sokol dropped out at the last minute, citing health reasons. Konovalov is one of few regional leaders not backed by the Kremlin who remains in office.

Top 10 trending phones of week 36,"One phone was on everyone's mind these days as it prepares to make its official debut. The iPhone 15 Pro Max will break with tradition and become more than just a lager iPhone Pro - the periscope telephoto camera will make it a considerably more exciting cameraphone than its siblings in the upcoming iPhone 15 lineup. And with Apple's upcoming flagship topping our week 36 chart, it was Huawei's newly announced Mate 60 Pro+ to slot in second. The most popular phone in our database for 2023 - the Samsung Galaxy A54 makes it three different makers on the podium. Last week's leader - the Huawei Mate 60 Pro - is now down to fourth, just ahead of the Galaxy S23 Ultra, which slides down to fifth. We then have the Redmi Note 12 Pro and Redmi Note 12 in sixth and seventh, edging another rumored phone. It's not another member of the Apple iPhone 15 lineup though, instead it's the Pixel 8 Pro, which in the usual Google fashion is leaking with such intensity that we know most of its bits and pieces well before its announcement. The Redmi 12 took ninth, while the iPhone 14 Pro Max comes in tenth and makes this entire edition of the chart an iPhone Pro Max sandwich. That means we lose the Sony Xperia 5 V and the Galaxy pair of A34 and A14. We expect more new faces next week as Apple delivers its Wunderlust event on Tuesday so it will be interesting to see which current members will survive the onslaught. See you next week!

The Serb won 6-3, 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 to become the oldest ever men's champion in New York in the Open era and levelled Margaret Court's all-time mark for most Grand Slam titles won in tennis history. The 36-year-old, who earlier won the Australian Open and French Open titles this year before being denied the same in Wimbledon by Carlos Alcaraz, also became the first male player to win three majors in a single calendar year four times in his career and on Monday he will officially return to the world No. 1 spot in the ATP rankings chart.

China’s Yin Ruoning becomes women’s golf world number one,"China’s Yin Ruoning became the world number one in women’s golf on Sunday by finishing third at the LPGA Queen City Championship. The 20-year-old became only the second Chinese woman to claim the world number one ranking after Feng Shanshan, who reached the summit from November 2017 to April 2018. “It means a lot. For me it’s like dream come true,” Yin said. “I’ve got goosebumps. World number one is the big step on the way to chasing Shanshan.” Yin will play on a Chinese team coached by Feng in the Asian Games, which open on September 23 on home soil at Hangzhou. “I didn’t get a lot of chance to chat with Shanshan,” Yin said. “But I’m looking forward to going back to China and play the Asian Games and spend more time with her, considering she’s the head coach on our national team.” Yin, who needed a top-four result to overtake American Lilia Vu for the top spot, missed out by two strokes on a playoff for the Queen City title between Australia’s Minjee Lee, who won the title with a birdie on the second extra hole, and England’s Charley Hull. But Yin fired a final-round five-under par 67 to finish third on 14-under 274 at Kenwood Country Club in Cincinnati, Ohio, and become the fifth different player atop the rankings this year. “It’s just amazing,” Yin said. “My mind is blank right now.” Second-ranked Yin won her first major title in June at the Women’s PGA Championship, two months after collecting her first LPGA victory at the LA Open. Others atop the rankings this year included New Zealand’s Lydia Ko, Americans Vu and Nelly Korda and South Korea’s Ko Jin-young. Vu’s three triumphs this year included major wins at the Chevron Championship in April and the Women’s British Open in August. Yin never managed to share the lead, settling for her fourth third-place finish in five events, but did what she needed to leap to the top of the rankings. “I’m pretty comfortable,” Yin said. “Just every week I know I’m in good spot and every week I can put myself into that winning circle. It’s just amazing to see I can play good, but also consistent.” Yin sandwiched birdies at the par-5 second and fourth holes around another at the par-3 third to charge into third early. She began the back nine with a birdie and added another at the par-5 15th to solidify her hold on the spot, then parred her way to the clubhouse. “Before this week, I know (depending on) what position I finish, I can be the world number one,” Yin said. “I just keep that in my mind. “Last hole I checked the leaderboard. I was like, ‘OK, another week finishing third, but I’m assuming I’ll be the world number one.’” Comments Related stories Related Topics",sports
Novak Djokovic not setting any limit on Grand Slam titles after US Open win,"Novak Djokovic said he plans to play as long as possible while he is still capable of competing for the biggest prizes after winning a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam title at the US Open on Sunday. The 36-year-old Djokovic defeated Daniil Medvedev in straight sets to pull level with Margaret Court’s all-time mark for most major singles crowns. Half of Djokovic’s Grand Slam triumphs have come since he turned 30. The Serbian has also won seven of the past 10 majors he has entered. “I’m going to keep going. You know, I feel good in my own body. I still feel I got the support of my environment, of my team, of my family,” said Djokovic. “Grand Slams... have been always the highest goal and the priority of mine in the whole season. “I don’t play as much in terms of other tournaments, so I try to, you know, prioritise my preparation so that I can peak in Slams.” Djokovic will return to world number one Monday for a record-extending 390th week, replacing Alcaraz at the top. Alcaraz is the only man to have beaten Djokovic this year at a Grand Slam. His five-set win in the Wimbledon final ruined the Serbian’s bid for a calendar Grand Slam, but any indication that signalled the passing of the torch was shown to be premature in New York. “Knowing that I play at such a high level still and I win the biggest tournaments in this sport, yeah, I don’t want to get rid of this sport,” said Djokovic. “I don’t want to leave this sport if I’m still at the top, if I’m still playing the way I’m playing.” Djokovic admitted there are times he questions his future in a sport he has dominated for well over a decade. “Occasionally asking myself, why do I need this still at this stage after all I have done, you know? How long do I want to keep going? I do have these questions in my head, of course,” he said. But his habit of setting himself increasingly lofty goals as his career has progressed means there are few thoughts of calling it a day any time soon unless his body dictates otherwise. “I don’t put any number right now in my mind on how many Slams I want to win until the end of my career. I don’t really have any number,” said Djokovic. “I’ll continue to prioritise them as my most important tournaments and where I want to play the best tennis. “So that will not change. That will stay the same in the next season or I don’t know how many more seasons I have in my legs. So let’s see.” His coach Goran Ivanisevic joked that Djokovic’s unquenchable thirst for success could see him carry on until the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. He also said there was little chance Djokovic would hang up his racquet if he won next year’s Australian Open to claim the outright record with a 25th Grand Slam crown. “He just enjoying, he likes the challenges. Like you ask me 25, yeah, if he wins 25, he’s going to think, If I win 25, why not 26? It’s always one more, something more.” Comments Related stories Related Topics",sports

"Dutch recovers to beat Ireland in European Championship qualifying, Poland is in trouble","The Netherlands recovered from Virgil van Dijk conceding an early penalty to beat Ireland 2-1 and overcome a hurdle in its European Championship qualifying campaign. Van Dijk gave away a penalty for handball at a corner in just the second minute in Dublin and the spot kick was promptly converted by Ireland’s Adam Idah. Ireland’s physical style seemed to make the Netherlands wary in the early stages but the hosts soon conceded a penalty of their own when goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu tripped Denzel Dumfries, allowing Cody Gakpo to score from the spot. A strong Dutch start to the second half was rewarded when Wout Weghorst scored in the 56th after Dumfries headed on a ball from deep into his teammate’s path. The Netherlands and Greece are fighting for the second qualifying spot in Group B behind France, which is top with five wins from five games and didn’t play Sunday. Both the Netherlands and Greece have nine points after Greece beat Gibraltar 5-0 on Sunday, but Greece has played one more game.

Goals from Jasir Asani and Mirlind Daku — who scored just seconds after coming off the bench — gave Albania a win to overtake the Czech Republic by two points at the top of the group standings. Poland is fourth after three losses in five games. Albania has only qualified for a major tournament once before, at the 2016 European Championship. Moldova is also in contention to qualify. It’s level on eight points with the Czech Republic after beating the Faeroe Islands 1-0. Only the top two in each group qualify automatically for the tournament in Germany next year.

Just one point separates the top four teams in the group. Denmark dominated the game but couldn’t break through the Finnish defense. With the end of the match in sight, Finland dropped deep into its own penalty area, giving Højbjerg time and space on the edge of the box to line up a powerful, low shot which beat goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky. Denmark and Slovenia top Group H with 13 points — one point ahead of Finland and surprise contender Kazakhstan, which beat Northern Ireland 1-0. Kazakhstan has never before qualified for a European Championship or World Cup. Slovenia eased past San Marino 4-0. Montenegro beat Bulgaria 2-1 on a goal from Stevan Jovetic in the seventh minute of added time to put pressure on qualification rivals Hungary and Serbia in Group G. Montenegro played most of the second half with 10 players after a red card for Igor Vujacic. Hungary and Serbia are level on 10 points at the top of the group after Serbia beat Lithuania 3-1.

The Dutch star completed her third straight calendar-year Grand Slam, including a Golden Slam in 2021, when she also won the Paralympic gold medal. De Groot has won six straight U.S. Open titles and 20 major singles titles overall — not that she keeps count. “I’d like to really not worry about it too much, because then you’re going to start to think about, ‘Oh, I want to reach this or I want to reach that,’” she said. “I really just want to focus on my game, and that’s what I did today. So that’s what I’m really proud of. But I think just being this consistent is what I’m really proud of. Being able to do it multiple times in the year.” De Groot hasn’t lost a Grand Slam singles match since falling in the French Open semifinals in 2020. Alfie Hewett, the No. 2 seed, beat Gordon Reid 6-4, 6-3 in a matchup of British players to win his fourth U.S. Open men’s title. Comments Related stories Related Topics",sports
England recovers from woeful start to beat New Zealand by 79 runs in rain-affected 2nd ODI,"From 8-3 after 4.2 overs, England rallied brilliantly to post 226-7 and then skittle New Zealand for 147 to win a rain-affected second match of its one-day international series by 79 runs on Sunday. Liam Livingstone plundered an unbeaten 95 off 78 balls to push England to a respectable total after the match had been reduced to 34 overs per team because of morning rain that delayed the start by three hours. That score didn’t look on when Trent Boult, playing his 100th ODI, put England in a hole early by removing Jonny Bairstow (6), Joe Root (0) and Ben Stokes (1) in a stunning start for New Zealand. Only Daryl Mitchell (57 in 52) and Will Young (33) got above 20 in the chase by the tourists, which ended after only 26.5 overs with David Willey (3-34) and Reece Topley (3-27) having England’s best bowling figures. The four-match series is 1-1 heading into the third ODI at The Oval on Wednesday. New Zealand won the opening match by eight wickets in Cardiff. The teams tied their Twenty20 series 2-2 last week and will meet in the first match of the 50-over Cricket World Cup in India on Oct. 5, when England will be defending its title after beating New Zealand in an epic 2019 final. After the early blitz from Boult (3-37), Matt Henry got a top-edge from Harry Brook (2) for a soft dismissal and Livingstone — down at No. 7 — was brought to the crease sooner than expected on 55-5 when Jos Buttler dragged spinner Mitchell Santner onto his stumps for a quickfire 30 off 25 balls. The big-hitting Livingstone steadied the innings by sharing partnerships of 48 with Moeen Ali (33) and, most tellingly, 112 with Sam Curran (42). It was his second straight fifty of the series after 52 off 40 in the first ODI won by New Zealand in dominant fashion on Friday. It was Livingstone’s third ODI half-century in 12 matches, with a pulled six off Henry getting England past 200 — a milestone that looked beyond the hosts a couple of hours earlier. He thumped nine fours as well as that one six in his longest innings in any format since 2019. It was a big innings for Livingstone, a fixture in England’s World Cup-winning Twenty20 team but in a fight to nail a place in the ODI team. “I think that’s what I’ve been crying out for — I’ve been looking for one-day cricket to have proper time in the middle,” he said. “It’s weird, I’ve won the World Cup but probably had the worst year of my career for form and had two bad injuries. It’s been a tough couple of months. “I’m a better player than someone who comes in and just slogs it at the end.” Willey struck with the second ball of New Zealand’s reply, snaking through the defense of Finn Allen — one of three changes made by the Black Caps — and knocking back middle stump. Devon Conway, an unbeaten centurion in Cardiff like Mitchell, made a scratchy 14 before driving loosely and edging behind to give Gus Atkinson his first ODI wicket. Mitchell overturned being given out on 0 but Young was stopped in his tracks by Willey’s direct hit for a run-out. Topley then followed up a parsimonious opening five-over spell by ending a 56-run union between Mitchell and New Zealand captain Tom Latham (19), who hung his bat out uncertainly and edged behind to Buttler. Having claimed his first wicket in five ODIs, Topley swung the game in England’s favor in his next over by taking a return catch off Glenn Phillips before Ravindra wafted to slip two balls later. Mitchell, as he had done at Sophia Gardens, bristled with intent. And after going to 50 at better than a run a ball, he launched Ali back over his head for six. However, he was dismissed when clubbing a full toss to mid-off from Ali’s very next ball. New Zealand’s hopes vanished with his departure and Willey claimed the last two wickets in quick succession. “Willey and Topley were impressive,” said Buttler, England’s captain. “We spoke about improving our powerplay bowling from the other day. We were very good throughout the innings with the ball.” Comments Related stories Related Topics",sports

"I.N.D.I.A. 4, NDA 3: Five Key Takeaways from Bypoll Results In Six States Ahead Of 2024","Bypoll Results: The recent bypolls held for seven seats in six states have thrown up mixed results, which were declared on September 8. These were the first elections since the formation of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (I.N.D.I.A.) by Opposition parties and a rebranded National Development Alliance (NDA) was created by the BJP. The I.N.D.I.A. bloc won four seats while the NDA won three, with no change in the overall tally. However, the results show some interesting trends and send out key messages ahead of the general elections to be held in 2024. Of the total seven seats, five were retained by the incumbent party. Among the other two seats, the BJP wrested Boxanagar (Tripura) from the CPM, but lost the Dhupguri seat in West Bengal to the ruling TMC. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); 5 Key Takeaways From The Bypoll Verdict 1. Tripura: BJP Gets 1st Muslim MLA, Little Of Left Remains In Boxanagar seat of Tripura, the CPM and the BJP were locked in a direct contest after the death of the Left MLA, Samsul Haque in July this year. The BJP achieved a significant milestone in Tripura's political landscape as the party got its first MLA from the Muslim community. Party candidate Tafajjal Hossain won the seat by over 30,000 votes. He had lost the seat by a whisker, less than 5,000 votes, six months ago. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been emphasising to the BJP cadre the need to make an outreach to the marginalised sections of society. The results show slow and steady progress made by these efforts. Also, the results further weaken the Left Front in Tripura, once its bastion. The CPM is now a major force only in Kerala. 2. West Bengal: Dhupguri Result May Redraw State Alliances Ahead Of 2024 In Dhupguri, which fell vacant after the death of BJP's Bishnupada Roy, the TMC, the BJP and the CPM locked horns, with the Congress backing the CPM candidate. So two parties from the I.N.D.I.A. bloc contested this seat. Contrary to popular perception that unity of all the three forces (TMC, Congress, Left) is a must to defeat the BJP in the state, the results show that the TMC benefitted from a triangular contest. The TMC won the seat by 4,300 votes, with the CPM polling more than 13,000 votes, holding onto its strength. The decades old CPM-TMC rivalry means the CPM along with the BJP gets a portion of the anti-TMC or anti-Mamata Banerjee votes. The Left also gets some minority community votes, which would otherwise go to the TMC if it doesn’t contest. However, if all three join hands, the TMC may stand to lose more than it gains as all the anti-TMC vote would then get consolidated in favour of the BJP. Polarisation always helps the BJP, research has shown. So we could see friendly fights in Bengal from the I.N.D.I.A. bloc. 3. UP: BSP Has A Message For I.N.D.I.A. In the most high-pitch battle among the seven bypolls, the SP managed to retain the seat vacated by the ghar-wapsi of Dara Singh Chauhan to the BJP. Dara Singh Chauhan’s re-entry along with OP Rajbhar’s return to the NDA fold was expected to give a boost to the BJP’s prospects in Purvanchal where the party suffered losses in 2019 Lok Sabha elections and 2022 state polls. Chauhan, a BJP heavyweight and former OBC Morcha president, had left the BJP ahead of the 2022 state elections. After the BJP’s comeback at state level, he re-joined the party hoping to get back in power. He has been a big party hopper all his life, moving from the Congress to the SP to the BSP to the BJP to the SP to the BJP again, and voters seem to have shown mirror to these breed of politicians. The BSP did not contest, the party has 20-35% vote share in this seat over the elections since 2002. The seat has a good number of minority and Dalit population (40%-45%). BSP had put up a minority candidate in 2022, and his votes seem to have got transferred to the SP candidate largely. Mayawati seems to have a covert message for the I.N.D.I.A. block — that it can gain strength if the BSP is included. A bipolar contest in 2024 could go either way. She could still join the bloc if a good bargain is given to her, else could split the opposition/anti-BJP vote in 2024. UP's Ghosi was the only seat in this round of bypolls where it was a direct NDA vs I.N.D.I.A. contest. 4. Sympathy Factor Still Works, Mostly Five of the bypolls — Dhupguri, Puthuppally, Bageshwar, Dumri and Boxanagar — were necessitated due to the death of the sitting MLAs. In Ghosi and Dhanpur, their MLAs' resignation led to fresh polls. Samajwadi Party's Dara Singh Chauhan had resigned as MLA in Ghoshi and re-joined the BJP. In Dhanpur, BJP's Pratima Bhoumik had resigned to retain her Lok Sabha seat, which left the assembly seat vacant. Generally, in bypolls necessitated by death, the deceased’s party enjoys sympathy and the seat is retained by the party. Of the five seats, this trend was maintained in three seats as the incumbent party put up family members of the deceased as their candidate. 5. Trend Of Ruling Party Having An Advantage In Bypolls Holds Good It has been a trend that party in power generally wins in such bypolls because of the administrative control. Also, since these seat elections have no bearing on the power situation in the states, these tend to get very hyperlocal. In five of the seven seats, this trend was maintained. Only in Kerala and UP, the seats were won by opposition parties — the Congress and the SP, respectively. To sum up, the state election results may not have a significant impact on the Lok Sabha elections to be held next year, as the context and character of polls are different. However, since these polls were held very close to the general elections, the underlying themes cannot be ignored altogether.",politics
WhatsApp Working On New 'Filter Group Chats' Feature On Android,"San Francisco: Meta-owned WhatsApp is reportedly working on a new feature -- ""filter groups chat"" on Android, to provide users with better control over their conversations, making it easier to manage and prioritise their messages. According to WABetaInfo, the new feature will allow users to get a list of their groups by excluding individual chats. Users will also notice that the ""Personal"" filter has been renamed ""Contacts"" to better distinguish between individual and group chats, as the ""Personal"" filter previously included groups and communities. The new ""Contacts"" filter, on the other hand, will only include individual conversations. Furthermore, the ""Business"" filter has been removed, the report said. As users often join multiple groups for various purposes, such as work, family, friends, or hobbies -- this dedicated filter will let them quickly access and manage their group conversations, knowing that this filter exclusively includes group chats. The feature to filter group chats is under development and it will be available in a future update of the app, according to the report. Meanwhile, WhatsApp is reportedly rolling out a multi-account feature with a new interface for the app settings to beta testers on Android. With this multi-account feature, users will be able to add an additional account on the same device directly right within WhatsApp Settings. The second feature is a redesigned settings interface, which will give users a more modern experience when navigating through the app's various options. The update also includes a redesigned profile tab right within the chat list, making it easier for users to open the settings of the app.",technology

Jawan: Mukesh Chhabra Says THIS Role Was The Hardest To Cast In Shah Rukh Khan's Film,"Casting director Mukesh Chhabra is a popular name in Bollywood, having worked on blockbuster films like Dangal, PK, and now Shah Rukh Khan’s Jawan and Dunki. In a recent interview, he said that after he read Jawan’s script, he realized that the film would be a mega success at the box office. He also revealed which was the toughest role to cast and how long it took to finalize the actors. In an interview with The Indian Express, Mukesh was asked which was the toughest casting for the Atlee directorial Jawan. He said, “The three new girls! There had to be a fresh approach, a lot of thought went into it. Like for example, Ashlesha Thakur, who plays Vijay Sethupathi’s daughter and is in the metro sequence."" Talking about Ashlesha’s role, Mukesh said that it was intentional that The Family Man’s actress was cast in the same film as Priyamani, who plays her mother in the web series. “I don’t know how many people will get it. By now, of course, Ashlesha has aged and we thought this pairing of her and Priyamani people have seen, so let’s play with it! A lot of thinking goes into it, which is why there is a lot of handwork, irrespective of whether people notice the nuggets or not. I go mad about casting, I love every little detail of it,"" he added. Mukesh revealed that it took him more than a year to cast the 165 actors featured in the film. Talking about the film’s interesting ensemble cast, he said, “I thought let’s mix the casting with slightly known faces and add some new ones. Out of the six girls, Priyamani is known in Bollywood as well as South, Girija Oak is known in Marathi and Hindi cinema, Sanya Malhotra is a popular Bollywood actor, and then I found three new girls in Sanjeeta Bhattacharya, Lehar Khan, Aaliyah Qureishi.

Hydration Simplified: How Much Water To Drink and When For A Healthier You,"Have you ever wondered why we're constantly reminded to stay hydrated, even when we don't feel particularly thirsty? It all boils down to the fact that our bodies continuously lose water through processes like sweating and urination. Water also plays a crucial role in various vital bodily functions, such as flushing out bacteria, aiding digestion, transporting nutrients to our cells, preventing constipation, and maintaining the delicate balance of electrolytes (especially sodium). So, it's obvious that we need to replenish the lost fluids by drinking plenty of water, but how much? Also Read: 8 Most Hydrating Drinks Besides Water The ""eight-glass water rule"" has been a popular guideline in the health and fitness world for some time. This rule suggests that we should aim to drink eight glasses of water a day. But here's the catch: this rule isn't one-size-fits-all. The ideal amount of water you need can depend on several factors, including your lifestyle, gender, age, activity level, and other factors. While the eight-glass rule is a decent starting point, your water needs are unique to you, so it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional to determine your precise requirements. If you have a sedentary lifestyle, work in an air-conditioned environment, and don't sweat much, consuming two to two and a half litres of water daily should suffice. Drinking more than this can lead to over-hydration . Nutritionist Dr Anju Sood recommends a daily intake of 2.5 litres to replenish water loss effectively. She emphasises that dehydration can lead to issues like severe headaches and mood swings, even when people don't drink enough water. However, individuals with high activity levels, such as athletes or those engaged in intense workouts, may require more water due to increased water loss through sweating. Consultant nutritionist Dr Rupali Datta suggests that the eight-glass rule, or even just four glasses in the morning, lacks a strong scientific basis. Instead, she recommends a guideline of 35 ml of water per kilogram of body weight. The primary goal is to stay adequately hydrated at all times, which becomes even more critical during the hot summer months. Also Read: 7 Delicious Drinks To Help You Stay Hydrated Drinking the right amount of water is important. Photo Credit: iStock Morning Hydration: Drinking water in the morning after waking up helps activate your internal organs and prepare your body for the day ahead. Post-Workout: After exercising, hydrating helps regulate your heart rate and aids in recovery. Before Meals: Consuming water about half an hour before a meal can improve digestion and prevent overeating. After Meals : The same rule applies. Ideally, you should give your body a time of half an hour to digest the food eaten, and then consume water. Time Of The Day: The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies by Vasant Lad suggests drinking the most water during the hottest part of the day, i.e. from mid-morning to early evening. Health Issues: Your body gives you cues to let you know it needs water. One is, the colour of urine, dark yellow colour may indicate dehydration. Dry chapped lips are one of the indicators of a dehydrated body. Try to drink more water under these circumstances. When Feeling Unwell: Proper hydration is crucial when you're sick to support your body's functioning and recovery. When Feeling Fatigued : Drinking water when tired can help re-energise your system and provide a much-needed boost. Also Read: Why You Shouldn't Drink Water Immediately After Meals suggests drinking water while sitting. Drinking water while standing can throw away the balance of bodily fluids. If you sit and drink, your muscles are more relaxed to reap the benefits in a better way. Ayurvedic expert, Dr. Akhilesh Sharma warns against gulping down large volumes of water in a single breath. It is better to sip on the water slowly while breathing normally. Icy chilled water is not great for digestion. Instead have room temperature or moderately cold water during hot days. According to Dr Akhilesh, warm water is even better as it helps in regulating cholesterol levels. Water is indeed essential for our survival. Don't ignore and hydrate yourself the right way.

Asia Cup: Shreyas Iyer's latest injury adds to India's selection headache,"India's opening batsmen, Shubman Gill and Rohit Sharma, scored fifties in the Super Four clash of the Asia Cup against Pakistan. Gill played aggressively, hitting six boundaries, while Rohit struggled against Pakistan pacer Naseem Shah. However, Rohit found his form against leg-spinner Shadab Khan, Just before the India innings hit the halfway mark, rain came pelting down and left the ground in unplayable condition once it stopped, forcing the umpires to suspend the match, which will resume from the same stage on Monday.

‘Rain saved Pakistan’: Watch Shoaib Akhtar's veiled jab at Babar Azam,"In a turn of events where both teams could claim divine intervention, the Asia Cup 2023 Super Four match between India and Pakistan found itself at the mercy of the weather gods. Initially dominated by Indian batsmen Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill, the much-anticipated cricket battle was halted due to persistent rain, and would resume from where it left off the next day, September 11. Rainfall, proving to be an equaliser of sorts, had the last word in a game where India's opening duo put Pakistan's bowling attack to the sword. The pair both reached half-centuries, with Sharma scoring 56 runs and Gill contributing 58. They hammered the Pakistani bowlers, lifting Team India to a commanding position before showers interrupted play. Former Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar, who was in attendance, was caught on video commenting on the rain. In the clip that later spread like wildfire on social media, he said, “Hey guys, it's me, Shoaib. I came to watch the match, we were all waiting, Indian and Pakistani fans. Rain saved us. India were in trouble the other day. Rain saved India. Today, we were in trouble and, thanks to Allah, rain saved us."" In what seemed like a sarcastic remark, the Rawalpindi Express suggested that the rain came as a blessing for Pakistan, especially given the strong opening performance by Indian batsmen Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill. Pakistan finally saw some respite when their bowler Shadab Khan managed to dismiss Sharma, followed shortly by Shaheen Afridi sending Gill back to the pavilion. Yet, before any significant momentum could be built, a heavy downpour forced the covering of the pitch and ultimately led to the suspension of the match. Watch: While the ground staff made efforts to ready the field, their attempts were in vain. Multiple pitch inspections by the umpires yielded no positive results, compelling the match officials to postpone the game. The high-voltage clash will resume from the same point today, September 11, weather permitting. Both sides will be eagerly looking for an opportunity to finish what they started, as they vie for the prestigious Asia Cup title.",sports
Every Google app updated for Android tablets [U],"At I/O 2022, Google announced that it will update over 20 of its first-party apps for large screens in a show of its commitment to the form factor. This will undoubtedly improve the experience for existing owners and is meant to encourage other developers to do the same. Here’s every Google app on Android that has a tablet update and what’s still to come. —Google Docs, Sheets, Slides III Update 9/10 : Google Workspace’s editor apps on Android now look like their web counterparts. Instead of a solid app bar, there’s a pill-shaped Material 3 toolbar for font and formatting. Other controls for undo/redo, text/paragraph (pop-up panel), insert, etc. appear in the top-right corner, along with live live collaborators. There’s also a side panel for comments, while Docs now defaults to opening in paginated and editing modes. ~ Update 7/2 : A dual-column view lets you “select a category on the left to view its details [on the right].” Google Play Books adds a navigation rail as we wait for Material You tweaks — amusingly, the app has had a M3 widget since March of 2022 — and you got the ( new ) app logo in the top-left corner. A search bar appears at the top along with top tabs (in Library) and a carousel of filters. Dual-column layouts are leveraged when viewing search results and in app listings to see suggested downloads. On tablets, Google has moved Calendar’s Schedule, Day, Week, and Month views — 3 days not offered — to the app bar. The first three display an always-visible monthly calendar at the left. That column is also where events you open appear and remain until closed. Google Weather features a sidebar where the 10-day forecast appears with high/low and condition. A search bar at the top notes your current location with a tap showing saved cites. A “Now” section consists of the Froggy weather mascot with animations that reflect the current condition, like a shining sun and moving clouds. You also get the “feels like” temperature here. This is followed by a 24-hour forecast carousel with cards — Wind, Humidity, UV Index, Pressure, and Sunrise & sunset — for “Current conditions.” Next to that is “Hourly details” by Precipitation, Wind, and Humidity. Recorder on the Pixel Tablet (and Fold) leverages dual-column layouts throughout the app. On the home screen (large FAB in the bottom-right corner), you can view more of your recordings per screen. It extends to the player and when recording for a side-by-side waveform and transcription. ~ Update 6/11/23 : In exiting preview, the Google Home app also rolled out some tweaks to the tablet UI. This includes placing the contents of each tab in a container, while there’s a secondary navigation drawer when viewing Spaces in the Favorites tab and in Devices. Following the large screen layout in October , Gboard now has a split keyboard that works quite well given how Android tablets are typically pretty wide. You have the ability to have keys duplicated on the left and write, while switching to the standard layout is quite fast. ~ Update 4/4/23 : Navigation rail with four tabs, navigation rail, and Create FAB. A search bar spans two-thirds of the screen, while settings and your account avatar appear at the top-right corner. Overall, it looks a lot like the desktop website. —Google Keep III Long-press on notes to open side-by-side in a new window . There’s also the Single note widget . Google Contacts has been updated with a navigation rail and dual-column UI where your list of people appears at the left and details are at the right. The search bar doesn’t span the entire width of your screen here. The app’s other tabs have not been updated. ~ Update 12/21/22 : Google Meet has a two-column UI in both portrait and landscape orientations. The homescreen shows your call history, as well as upcoming meetings, on the left. Tapping loads the contact details page on the right for a nice info-dense interface. This dual-column layout is also found in the Meet tab of the Gmail app. The previous UI was just a stretched out list view that did not take advantage of the available screen real estate, especially in landscape. ~ Update 12/9 : Given the available screen real estate, Google is putting the live collaborator avatars into the app toolbar. To the right of the document name, you’ll see who is currently viewing a file, just like on the web. This information was previously housed in the overflow menu. This should apply to Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Keep’s dual-pane redesign has widely rolled out with a key tweak that lets you quickly switch between the Full screen and Dual pane views. This button appears in the search field next to your profile avatar. ~ Update 11/24 : The Google app has switched to (beta version 13.46) a navigation rail that’s positioned just above where you’d place your thumb rather than being centered, top, or bottom-aligned. It’s used for the Discover feed, Search results, and Collections tab. This will presumably get updated to Material You in the future, while Google should play around with padding so there isn’t as much empty space and more content. Currently in Public Preview, Google Home starts with a Material You navigation rail that makes use of pill-shaped indicators. You only see the text label of the current tab. In Favorites and Devices, Google switches to a three column layout for tiles. It’s up from two on the phone app, but a fourth would probably look fine, with such a view used by the Edit/Add favorites view. Meanwhile, Automations and Activity use a single column layout that is too stretched out, while Google looks to have not yet optimized the Settings column with a lot of left/right padding. The main views are mostly tablet-optimized, but going a level deeper into various device menus presents some issues that need to be adjusted and rethought before the stable launch. In comparison, the Google Home preview on iPad uses a bottom bar and it’s not that optimized. ~ Update 11/18 : Google Docs on Android is getting “full mouse support” that matches the website’s cursor experience. In Drive, drag and drop can now be used to organize your files and folders, with Google noting how this “can be done either in the two-window view or in the single app view.” Google Slides will support dragging text and images out of the app into others. ~ Update 11/11 : The Google One redesign is finally here with a navigation drawer replacing the awkward bottom bar on tablets that quite considerately cut into content. In portrait orientation, the app uses a navigation rail, but there’s otherwise enough space for the always-showing drawer. Meanwhile, the Home feed features a new grid of cards for available Storage, Backup status, the Cleanup Tool, and VPN state. The tablet app now matches the Google One website. Back in September , Google announced a dual pane layout for Keep that lets you simultaneously see your note list and actual contents. However, this side-by-side view requires a rather higher screen dp and we’ve only encountered it on a Chromebook so far. Otherwise, it’s quite nice. ~ Update 10/22 : Improvements to drag-and-drop in Google Sheets lets you drag, copy, and share charts and in-cell images to other apps, like Docs. Google is also rolling out link previews, like on the web, that “allows you to get context from linked content without bouncing between apps and screens.” A handful of new designs were previewed at Made by Google 2022 with the Pixel Tablet tease : Earlier this week, Google made official a Tab Grid for Chrome on Android. There’s also a gesture that lets you swipe across the Omnibox to quickly switch between tabs, and being able to load the desktop version of sites by default. Meanwhile, Tab Groups are coming soon to the large screen devices. The full Google Play tablet (and foldable) redesign that displays app screenshots, videos, and descriptions directly in the Apps and Games tabs/feeds will be available in 2023. Developers are advised to update their listings ahead of that. Gboard’s new tablet layout actually takes advantage of the extra screen real estate provided by a large screen. No longer feeling like a stretched out phone experience, the background sheet and keys get taller by default (in landscape). There are new keys for Tab, Caps Lock, Hide Keyboard, and Left/Right arrow, while others have been moved around. These updates are available with version 12.3 (beta) of Gboard and newer. ~ Update 9/30 : Ahead of a broader redesign, Google has updated the Play Store with a navigation rail that is more compact than the previous drawer. At the moment, this allows app icons to be larger but those carousels will soon make way for cards . Google Play has also tweaked the corner logo and search field to be more compact. Update 9/17 : You can now open multiple instances of Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides (version 1.22.342.08.90+) to view them side-by-side. However, getting them to that state is a bit of a manual process. You open the first document and then go back to the Docs/Sheets/Slides app (using the system Recents multitasking menu) to launch the second. Reopen Recents and drag the first file to initiate split-screen. It’s not as easy as Drive’s “Open in new window” button, which has been renamed to “Open in split view” (and only works on folders). Update 9/13 : Google is optimizing widgets for Android tablets by making them larger given the additional screen real estate available. Drive (with version 2.22.357.1 ) adds a row of shortcuts to the Drive quick actions widget that creates a new document in Docs, Sheets, or Slides. This homescreen object is also notable for introducing a new circular configuration . Meanwhile, the Google Keep (5.22.342.03.90) Note List widget gets rid of the right sidebar for a faux bottom bar in narrow configurations. This matches the Gmail widget and lets you see more notes. However, you can still get the old design by increasing the width. Update 8/28 : Google TV was one of the apps slated for a redesign at I/O. A tablet-optimized version is now available, but without the Material You stylings shown on-stage. The primary change is a navigation rail with centered tabs that replace the bottom bar. We’re seeing this new look with version 4.33.60.17, which is not yet widely rolled out, on a Chromebook. Back in May, Google’s slides depicted a much wider rail with oblong indicators noting your current tab. Meanwhile, the Material You iteration looks to redesign the app bar so it’s more seamless. The existing design is an issue in the Your stuff page where top tabs are used. Update 8/3 : Google announced last week that Drive and Docs/Sheets/Slides are getting tablet optimizations. Some of the features have rolled out, including the ability to: Update 6/6 : The tablet optimization announced for YouTube Music at I/O 2022 is now rolled out . It sees the Android app on large screens get a redesigned playlist view, which is a big part of the service. There’s a two-column UI where cover art and other details appear at the left and the song list is on the other side. [ Update 6/30 : The redesign was introduced to albums later on .] This is just the latest in tablet update for YouTube Music, with that team starting earlier this year on the Home feed to let you see more content in carousels ( Listen again , Your favorites, Mixed for you, etc.) without having to scroll. Other optimizations exist in Now Playing (two-column view with controls at the left and your Up next queue at the right) and side-by-side settings . Update 6/3 : Google Clock 7.2 starts by introducing a left-sided navigation rail on tablets that gives the app more vertical space as a result. The other big change is the use of two-column layouts, when in landscape orientation, throughout the application. Update 5/25 : Version 8.2 of Google’s Calculator app brings a two-column layout where you can always see your calculation “History” on tablets and other large screen devices. Other parts of the UI are shrunken down accordingly and this is particularly suited for multitasking. Update 5/18 : Version 13.19 of the Google app lets Google Lens open in landscape mode. The visual search tool was previously restricted to portrait orientation on Android. Google’s premier tablet app on Android is Google Photos, and this update rolled out in January of 2021 . It’s not too different from the web UI. A navigation rail on the left edge means you can see slightly more vertical content, while more tabs can be shown – compared to a bottom bar – without looking cramped. In addition to Photos, Search, Sharing, and Library, you have quick access to On Device, Utilities, Archive, and Trash. One small Material You tweak that Google made in recent months is a pill-shaped indicator to note what tab you’re viewing instead of just highlighting the icon. At the top of the screen, next to “Google Photos,” is a search bar with rounded corners. When viewing a photo fullscreen, swiping up reveals a right-hand pane while the overflow in the top-right corner of the viewer shows actions with accompanying icons. I’ve already opined how Google Calendar is my favorite tablet app, primarily because of the great Day and Schedule views where you see the entire month on the left with a list of events next to it while illustrations liven up the background. It does not appear that the company is planning any changes. Chrome on Android tablets is nearly identical to the desktop interface given the use of tab strips and Omnibox layout. There’s also support for multiple windows to aid multitasking. YouTube is fairly well-optimized for tablets with two-column views throughout, and Google’s I/O preview only showed the player screen. It could always switch to a navigation rail. Translate already has the tablet optimizations touted on stage. In general, it’s better for this app to be sparse and have a lot of spacing, given its nature as a (physically) shared interface/tool. Google apps getting more tablet tweaks Maps for Android already has a two-column view, but an upcoming update replaces the full-width bottom bar with one that fits in the left panel.

"Novak Djokovic reveals his retirement plans, says, ‘I will leave tennis in about…’","At 36, Novak Djokovic has shown he's not ready to pass the torch to the next generation just yet. With Roger Federer retired and Rafael Nadal planning to step away after the next season, the era of the 'Big Three' in tennis may be fading, but Djokovic, the last member of that triumvirate, proved his enduring prowess. His 6-3, 7-6(5), 6-3 victory over Daniil Medvedev at the U.S. Open marked his fourth Flushing Meadows title and equaled a record with his 24th Grand Slam crown. Djokovic clearly has his sights set on more accomplishments in tennis. Djokovic said, ""Occasionally asking myself, why do I need this still at this stage after all I have done, you know? How long do I want to keep going? I do have these questions in my head, of course"" ""Knowing that I play at such a high level still and I win the biggest tournaments in this sport, yeah, I don't want to get rid of this sport or I don't want to leave this sport if I'm still at the top."" Djokovic defeated young American talents Taylor Fritz and Ben Shelton on his way to the final. He then confronted Daniil Medvedev, an older rival who had previously thwarted his calendar Grand Slam bid. Djokovic seized the chance, outlasting Medvedev in grueling rallies. ""My team, my family knew that the last 24 hours, don't touch me, don't speak to me about, you know, the history of what's on the line,"" he said. ""I really did my best to keep things quite simple and stick to the routines that brought me to where I am and treat this match really as any other match where I just need to win."" He matched Nadal's 22 major titles in Australia and claimed the men's record by winning Roland Garros. A loss to Carlos Alcaraz at Wimbledon made Djokovic ponder a generational shift but his victories in Cincinnati and at Flushing Meadows reaffirmed his dominance in men's tennis for the time being. ""You know, players come and go,"" he said. ""It will be the same kind of destiny for me. Eventually one day I will leave tennis in about 23, 24 years. ""And there is going to be new young players coming up. Until then, I guess you'll see me a bit more.""",sports

Sebastian Vettel Raises German Argument as He Provides Concerning Outlook About Mick Schumacher’s Future,"Germans for long have dominated the sport of F1. Michael Schumacher has arguably been the best among them, winning seven world championships. Soon after, Sebastian Vettel extended the German foothold in F1 by winning four more titles from 2010 to 2013. Three years later, Germany had another champion when Nico Rosberg beat Lewis Hamilton to the title. However, since 2016, the outlook for Germans in F1 looks bleak. This is exactly the argument that Vettel brought up when he discussed Mick Schumacher’s future in a recent interview with . Advertisement Even though Mick is the son of a seven-time F1 champion, he has not found it easy in F1. The 24-year-old joined the sport in 2021 as a driver for Haas. He spent two seasons with them, following which the team parted ways with him because of his repeated crashes. Haas team principal Guenther Steiner has always been critical of the young German. The 58-year-old pointed out that with Mick costing his side a whopping due to crashes, the team could not afford to continue their partnership. Advertisement However, Mick believes that Haas never treated him well in the first place and has often explained how Mercedes is currently nurturing him even though he is only a reserve driver for them. While the 24-year-old cannot join the Silver Arrows due to the team’s commitment to their two drivers, there were rumors that he could join . However, that door seems to have shut on him as well. It is for this reason that Vettel believes that the future of his is concerning. Sebastian Vettel believes Mick Schumacher is currently the only young German talent While speaking to Sky Sports in a recent interview about Mick Schumacher’s hopes for the future in F1, Sebastian Vettel (as quoted by f1only.fr), “ “. Vettel is referencing the opportunity available at Alfa Romeo, which will become the works team of Audi in 2026.

However, unfortunately for Schumacher, all doors seem to have closed on him. Mercedes team principal recently explained how the 24-year-old may not get a seat in F1 next season after Williams confirmed that they are deciding to stick with Logan Sargeant. Williams is unwilling to replace Sargeant with Schumacher While speaking in a recent interview, Williams team principal James Vowles made it clear that his side is unwilling to lose faith in Logan Sargeant just yet. Since the American has been struggling this season, many believe that the British outfit may consider replacing him with someone like Mick Schumacher. Despite the same, Vowles has vehemently , “ .” Hence, with Schumacher’s last hope seemingly bailing on him, the 24-year-old may need to stick with Mercedes for another season as their reserve driver or move to some other form of motorsport.

"Dhiraj loses bronze play-off, India returns with a silver from Archery World Cup Final","Dhiraj Bommadevara showed some spark when he shocked two-time Olympic team gold medallist Kim Woojin 6-2 but lost his next two matches to return empty-handed as India ended its campaign with a solitary silver medal in the ‘Archery World Cup Final’. Compound archer despite India fielding its biggest-ever contingent of five archers in the World Cup’s season-ending grand finale. Rising Indian recurve archer Dhiraj began his campaign on a rousing note when he rallied from 0-2 to pull off an upset 28-29, 30-28, 30-28, 29-26 win over the World No. 2 Korean heavyweight in the men’s quarterfinals here on Sunday. But the 22-year-old Army archer faltered against another Korean Lee Woo Seok as he went down 1-7 (28-28, 27-30, 28-30, 28-29) in the semifinal to be left to fight for the third-place playoff, where he was up against Medellin World Cup winner Mauro Nespoli. The bronze medal contest went down to the wire with the Italian clinching the issue 6-5 (29-30, 27-27, 25-29, 27-26, 27-28) (10-9) in the shoot-off where Dhiraj dropped a point. Jayanta Talukdar remains the only male recurve archer to have won a World Cup Final medal -- bronze -- 13 years ago in Edinburgh. Dola Banerjee is the only Indian with a World Cup Final gold that came way back in Dubai 2007 in the women’s recurve section. In terms of medals, woman recurve archer Deepika Kumari is the most successful Indian, having won four silver medals at different World Cup Finals. The event is a year-ending world outdoor competition where a total of 32 archers, eight in each of the four championship categories, fight it out for the gold, silver and bronze medals. Archers qualify for the tournament by winning one of the circuit’s four stages -- in Antalya (Turkey), Shanghai (China), Medellin (Colombia) and Paris (France) -- or by climbing high enough in the World Cup Ranking with consistent finishes across the season to make it as a points qualifier.

"Djokovic lucky to have had rivals like Federer, Nadal, says Ivanisevic","Novak Djokovic has been fortunate to have opponents like Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal to push him during his career, his coach Goran Ivanisevic said on Sunday after the 36-year-old claimed the U.S. Open title for a 24th Grand Slam crown. The ‘Big Three’ dominated men’s tennis over the last two decades with a collective 66 Grand Slam titles between them but Djokovic is now clear of the retired Federer (20) and Nadal (22), who is expected to call time on his career next year. “He’s a winner,” former Wimbledon champion Ivanisevic told reporters. “He’s the guy who is motivating himself. “He had luck to have guys like Nadal and Federer, they came before him, so they pushed each other. “When you tell him he can’t do something, it’s even worse. Then he’s going to show you that he can do it. No excuses. He always tries to find a way to win, to fight, even when he’s not feeling well, injured, not injured.” Ivanisevic, who has been coaching Djokovic since 2019, said he considered the Serb’s U.S. Open triumph - which put him level with Margaret Court with the most major singles titles - as “the biggest achievement in sporting history”. The 51-year-old added that he was not surprised by Djokovic’s hunger. “He’s just enjoying, he likes the challenges. Like you ask me 25 (majors), yeah, if he wins 25 he’s going to think, ‘If I win 25, why not 26?’ It’s always one more, something more,” Ivanisevic said. “He’s taking care of his body, he’s taking care of everything, every single detail has to be perfect, prepared. He’s never happy on the court. “I don’t know if that’s good or bad, not good for us,” he said smiling. Comments Related Topics",sports
"‘Showing Off’ His $10,000 Wedding Gown, Dennis Rodman Uses His ‘Do Anything I Wanna Do’ Mentality To Promote His Brand","is an NBA legend who gained notoriety for his eccentricity. However, rather than denying it, The Worm embraced his persona very early on and continues to live by it. He often displayed this through his fashion choices, which included a $10,000 piece of clothing he dawned in the 90s. Nowadays, Rodman lives as he preaches, claiming he’ll do whatever he wants, regardless of what people think. A philosophy that he has utilized to promote and sell his own apparel. Advertisement Back in the 1990s, when he decided to marry himself. It was an eccentric move, yet one that wasn’t unfamiliar to him or even those who knew him. Wearing a $10,000 white wedding gown, the five-time NBA Champion caught the attention of the world. To the media, this looked like just another one of Rodman’s antics, but in reality, he perfectly utilized the situation to promote his autobiography. Dennis Rodman continues to be free-spirited and unapologetic about it even in his 60s In a shared on Instagram, fans got an all-new look at Dennis Rodman and his personality. The video featured an interview with Rodman where he talked about his eccentricism. He claimed that it did not bother him and that regardless of what people thought, he would continue to do what he wanted to do. Inspirational words, that were followed by the blaring of EDM (Electronic Dance Music). Advertisement The truth is, The Worm has always been free-spirited. He never let anything bother him and always did what made him feel best. However, this often got him in trouble. Whether it was taking a break between Finals games to go to Las Vegas, or accumulating exorbitant fines with his antics on the court. He unapologetically did what he wanted to do. This has persisted even to this day. At the age of 60, Rodman continues to be as free-spirited as ever. It is likely no amount of backlash or public criticism can change him. As far as he is concerned, all those who don’t like it can go to ‘hell’. Loading embed instagram https://www.instagram.com/reel/CxBmOURyJc_/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading Rodman has been applying this ideology to his current businesses. Having started his own brand, ‘Rodman Apparel’, the Hall of Famer has been spotted at several events fitted in his own products. This happened recently when he made an appearance at an AEW event. A perfect example of just how free-spirited he is. Advertisement Rodman once went against David Stern’s orders and got himself more tattoos In the ’90s, the NBA was intent on keeping a squeaky-clean image. As a result, having a player like Dennis Rodman, who was covered in tattoos, had earrings, and even dyed his hair was a problem. With this in mind, then-Commissioner, David Stern called Rodman into his office for a meeting. He informed him that he would have to stop getting tattoos and even threatened to have him removed from the league. It was a straightforward warning, but, as expected, one that The Worm didn’t care for. As the story goes, soon after the meeting, Rodman went out and got more tattoos, just to spite the commissioner. A move, that was in line with his eccentric and free-spirited personality. Rodman truly is a person who skips to the tune of his own beat. It does not matter whether you’re someone who holds a place of authority or just a random passer-by trying to share your criticism. Dennis Keith Rodman will do as he pleases. Advertisement",sports
Watch - Shaheen Afridi congratulates ‘new dad’ Bumrah with gift during India vs Pakistan Asia Cup game,"Pakistan’s pace bowling ace Shaheen Afridi was the talk of the town after he congratulated his Indian peer Jasprit Bumrah with a gift box, for becoming a father, for the first time. Spreading joy ? Shaheen Afridi delivers smiles to new dad Jasprit Bumrah ??? | The heart-warming moment happened on Sunday, after the Asia Cup game between both sides pushed onto the reserve day, following heavy rains in Colombo, with the video being shared by the social media handle of the Pakistan cricket team.

"Rohit, Gill partnership shows India’s PowerPlay woes seem to have turned a corner just ahead of the World Cup","Adulation cuts both ways, particularly when you are opening the batting for the Indian cricket team. It is true that Indian batters enjoy a cult following. But the scars of the 2017 Champions Trophy final, the 157 for no loss at the 2021 T20 World Cup, and the semifinal defeats of 2019 and 2022, events ingrained in recent popular culture memory, are testimony that it doesn’t take long for that fandom to turn on its head and for the burden of failure to land squarely at your doorstep. These were instances of India’s vaunted top order being reduced to shambles in the face of menacing pace, swing and seam. India found itself in a similar wreck in its Asia Cup 2023 opener against Pakistan but Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill ensured that their 121-run opening stand in the Super Four stage, against the same opposition, ended the sequence of ignominy. Though 121, unlike Pakistan’s 157 of the 2021 T20 World Cup, is unlikely to attain immortality considering the tenor and tone of the tournament, it holds the promise of brighter days. India’s exits in the last two T20 World Cups have stirred a debate around its PowerPlay approach. With a World Cup looming, the need for aggression at the top has percolated to one-dayers as well. Rohit signalled that intent off the last ball of the first over, flicking Shaheen Shah Afridi’s in-swinger off his pads for a six over deep square leg. Afridi’s insistence throughout his first spell on pitching the ball up, validated by India’s top-order’s struggles against left-arm swing, played into the openers’ hands. Gill took a toll on Afridi in the latter’s second over, flicking two successive full deliveries on the pads to the fine-leg and midwicket boundary. When Afridi pitched it outside off, Gill took a confident stride and pushed it down the ground for his third boundary in the over. He wasn’t done just yet. Afridi’s predictability of length meant that Gill skipped out in the left-armer’s third over and nonchalantly lifted the ball over mid-on for another four. When Afridi came around the wicket, Gill strode forward to drive through covers and then through point for back-to-back boundaries. Afridi, out of the attack, was shellacked for 31 in his first three overs, but Naseem Shah showed that the new-ball test was far from complete. Gill was in a spot off Naseem’s first delivery of the day when he miscued a cut and had the ball falling just short of Afridi at deep third. Naseem almost had him again slashing outside off, but the slip cordon was caught napping. Rohit, on the other hand, had gone into a shell as Naseem relentlessly homed in on the channel outside, kept it on the shorter side and moved it away off the seam. He extracted extra bounce and often caught Rohit leaden-footed during a period of 15 consecutive dot balls that the India skipper endured against the right-arm quick. But when Naseem pitched it fuller, Rohit’s eyes lit up and he flicked it over midwicket before unleashing his trademark pull to swat the ball away for four more. With the PowerPlay done, Rohit and Gill had rushed to 65 and sailed through the challenge that was tipped as the litmus test by some and a line in the sand by others as far as India’s World Cup hopes are concerned. 1?0?0?-run partnership! ? Captain Rohit Sharma & Shubman Gill continue to score at a brisk pace ? ? Follow the match ?? | | To be fair, India (5.39) is the second fastest-scoring team in ODIs since 2021, second only to England (5.67), which is on its own mission to warp space and time through vehemence. But that the numbers are skewed to some extent by the quality of the opposition of late is a valid suspicion. India scored at 6.7 runs an over in the PowerPlay against an under-par Sri Lanka and a depleted New Zealand pace attack at home earlier this year. But the corresponding figure dipped to 5.23 in the three-match series against Australia in March and the numbers weren’t encouraging against England (4.23), South Africa (4.4) and even Bangladesh (4.4) last year. The T20I PowerPlay awakening, following the 2021 T20 World Cup first-round exit, had been marshalled by Rohit himself, before the intent fizzled out in a 10-wicket defeat to England in the semifinal of the 2022 edition. The fear of pressure and quality bowling getting the better of the intent was reiterated against Pakistan in Pallekele last week when the top three were cleaned up playing timid shots, seemingly unnerved more by reputation than the merit of the delivery. But Rohit and Gill allayed those fears in Colombo with fifties of guts, substance and without losing the sense of occasion. Regardless of the result of the game, which was pushed into the reserve day after rain suspended play on Sunday, India’s batting fortunes may have turned a corner and crossed a mental block, and it bodes well with the World Cup less than a month away.

Byju’s proposes surprise repayment of $1.2 billion loan in less than 6 months: Report,"has put forth a proposal to fully repay its outstanding $1.2 billion term loan within a short span of six months. This move comes amid an ongoing dispute with its lenders that has lasted nearly a year. Sources who wished to remain anonymous revealed to Bloomberg that the Indian ed-tech giant has laid out a plan to remit $300 million within the first three months, conditional on acceptance of the amendment proposal. The balance would be cleared in the succeeding three months. However, lenders are currently scrutinising the proposal, with particular attention to the sources of repayment. LiveMint could not independently verify the report. The friction between Byju's and its lenders centres on renegotiations of its loan agreement, which have been fruitless thus far. The tension escalated when the company opted not to make an interest payment on the term loan, one of the most sizable taken by a startup worldwide. Also Read: Founded in 2015 by Byju Raveendran, whose parents were both educators, Byju’s raised the five-year term loan in 2022 with an aim to expand its footprint beyond India. The startup, officially known as Think & Learn Pvt, was at one point valued at a staggering $22 billion, making it one of India's most valuable . The present status of the loan is hardly encouraging, being quoted at just 49.8 cents on the dollar, Bloomberg added. Generally, any figure below 70 cents is classified as distressed, highlighting the gravity of the situation. Also Read: Spokespersons from both parties remained tight-lipped about the situation. A representative for the lenders refused to make any comments concerning Byju’s proposal while Bloomberg’s queries directed at Byju’s spokesperson received no immediate reply.

AR Rahman interview on his ‘Marakkuma Nenjam’ concert: I’m terribly disturbed and accountable for what happened,"AR Rahman’s latest Chennai concert, titled ‘Marakkuma Nenjam’, will be one that many remember for a long time. But not for the right reasons. With over 45,000 people descending on Chennai’s Adityaram Palace City on Sunday evening, scenes outside the concert venue told a story: of long queues, traffic snarls and mismanagement of ticket holders. While many fans who held valid tickets left the venue seething with rage, some got into arguments with policemen and organisers (ACTC Events) on the lack of proper arrangements. “It was a tsunami of people and love that we were unable to handle,” Rahman told The Hindu . “As a composer, my job was to give a terrific show, and I thought everything else would be taken care of. I was just thinking that it shouldn’t rain, and was happily performing inside, without any idea of what was happening outside. Our intentions were good, but I think the response was beyond our expectations. We are collecting the data now, and we will surprise fans with something soon.” “Right now, we are just terribly disturbed. Safety was the primary issue, especially because there were women and kids. I don’t want to point fingers at anyone, but we have to realise that the city is expanding, and the passion to consume music and art is also expanding.” The concert had already been rescheduled in a last-minute change from August to September owing to unfavourable weather conditions. Rahman had said the decision was taken with the guidance of authorities and to ensure the safety and well-being of his fans. Despite ‘Marakkuma Nenjam’ being one of India’s highest selling shows till date, the overselling of tickets and bad crowd management were among the many reasons fans were upset. Rahman explains, “The organisers (ACTC events) had put together about 46,000 chairs in the venue. In some sections, everybody sat on one side and didn’t move to the other side. Seeing this, the policemen on duty assumed that the venue was full and closed it. By this time, the show had already started inside.” Even as the composer and music team dished out his popular songs, packed with dance sequences and visuals, many fans outside were left unattended to. “This was like a cyclone we did not plan for. We did 20 concerts in the US last year, and everything was smooth and trouble free — because we trusted the system there. ‘Marakkuma Nenjam’ is India’s highest-sold show till date, which is great, but it is more important how we treat people than the actual concert itself. And that, I had little control over. I knew what all songs to pack in, which singers to rope in, and what musical surprises to give fans, but going forward, artistes have to take leadership on measuring contractually what goes into these arrangements.” Despite hosting several successful concerts across the world and Chennai, several of the Oscar winner’s fans had a bitter experience on Sunday evening. “For global experiences, we need to have an international setup. This is a lesson for me. It pushes me to go beyond being a musician, and get involved in infrastructure as well. I’ve been to many arts collective in the world, and when I see those, I think: why deny this experience to our own people right here in Chennai? They deserve that, and more. What it takes is what we discovered during this concert.” Rahman describes ‘Marakkuma Nenjam’ as a ‘90% success and a 10% loss’, with hits spanning 30 years being dished out for the audience. “Thousands of people inside were happily listening to the concert,” he says, “The energy and love in Chennai is overwhelming; sometimes, when you love something too much, it goes away from you. I think that’s what has happened here. I am ambitious about making Chennai an arts capital, but with respect to what happened, I do not want to point fingers at anyone because I know people come to concerts for me, and not for who the organisers are.” “We will face this and fix it, because every soul is important to me. I told my son (AR Ameen) this: anything that we do in partnership, people do not look at the partnership, they look at us. The partnerships might disappear, but we will remain. I now have to think beyond just the musical aspects of a concert. We will, hopefully, not let this happen ever again.”",entertainment
"Pooja Bhatt breaks silence on her iconic magazine cover kiss with father Mahesh Bhatt; says, “Shah Rukh ne mujhe yeh kaha tha…”","Pooja Bhatt, renowned for her multifaceted career in Bollywood as an actor and filmmaker, recently marked her debut in the world of OTT entertainment with Bigg Boss OTT 2. Surprisingly, the transition proved highly successful as Pooja managed to forge a profound connection with the digital audience, ultimately emerging as a finalist on the popular show. Pooja Bhatt breaks silence on her iconic magazine cover kiss with father Mahesh Bhatt; says, “Shah Rukh ne mujhe yeh kaha tha…” During an interview with Siddharth Kannan, Pooja was asked about her thoughts on a magazine photoshoot alongside her father, Mahesh Bhatt, which had garnered significant attention. In response, she exhibited her characteristic candour, stating, “No, because I see it very simple, and I think that unfortunately jo hota hai (what happens is), a frozen moment can be represented and misrepresented in anyway. Aur mujhe yaad hai Shah Rukh ne mujhe yeh kaha tha when you have daughters, jab hi aapke bacche chote hai (I remember Shah Rukh had told me that when you have daughters and when your child is small), how often a child just says, ‘Mummy papa give me a kiss’. And they go this way. Main ab bhi is umar mein bhi wahi 10 pound ki bacchi hoon for my father. Vo jindagi bher wahi rahege for me (At this age also I am still a 10 pound child for my father. He will always remain that way for me).” She further added, “So it was a moment that was absolutely innocent which was captured. Aur uske connotation jo hai, jinko padhna hai vo padhenge, jinko dekhna hai vo dekhege. Aur main is cheej ko defend karne nahi baithi. Agar log baap aur beti ke rishte ko alag najariye se dekh sakte hai toh vo kuch bhi kar sakte hai. Fir hum baat karte hai family values ki. Bahut kamal ka joke hai (Whatever its connotations, people may read it as they want, they will see it as they wish I cannot defend it here. If you want to see the relation between a father and a daughter in a different way then you can do anything. And then we talk about family values. What an amazing joke).” In the past, Mahesh Bhatt, who arrived at Bigg Boss OTT Season 2 to support his daughter Pooja Bhatt, had expressed his love and pride towards her as he emotionally revealed how the actress had been the biggest support to the family during tough and challenging times.

"Sooraj Pancholi opens up about his 7 year relationship; says, “I think my relationship with Jiah was probably the shortest relationship I have had”","Sooraj Pancholi, who garnered widespread attention earlier this year upon his acquittal from abetment to suicide charges related to the tragic death of late actor Jiah Khan, recently shared some personal insights in an interview. The actor disclosed that he has been in a committed relationship for the past seven years, shedding light on his romantic journey. Sooraj Pancholi opens up about his 7 year relationship; says, “I think my relationship with Jiah was probably the shortest relationship I have had” In an interview ETimes, Sooraj revealed that, surprisingly, his relationship with Jiah Khan was his shortest one. He expressed, “I think my relationship with Jiah was probably the shortest relationship I have had. After that, I have been in one relationship and it’s been about seven years now, and it is beautiful. There’s nothing in the world that can match up to the feeling of being in love, being taken care of, and doing the same for the other person. For me, this relationship it’s very personal because many have judged me unfairly as a bad lover or partner, but only those close to me know how I am. The general perception is misconstrued.” While Sooraj chose to keep his partner's identity discreet, he affirmed that she is not an actress and therefore preferred not to divulge her name. He elaborated, “She is not an actress and hence, I wouldn’t want to divulge her identity. Besides, I prefer to keep my relationship private because so much about me is out there already.” As for his future plans, especially regarding marriage, Sooraj hinted at the possibility, stating, “Maybe, in a few years.” For the unversed, Sooraj Pancholi, who was in a relationship with Jiah Khan when she died, was accused of abetting her commit suicide by Jiah's mother Rabi Khan after a big argument between the two. However, on April 28, the court acquitted the Sooraj of all charges, stating that there was insufficient evidence linking him to the abetment. Sooraj, the son of Zarina and Bollywood actor Aditya Pancholi, made his Bollywood debut in 2015 with the movie Hero, alongside Athiya Shetty. He appeared in court on the same day, accompanied by his mother and actress Zarina Wahab. Almost ten years before, on June 3, 2013, Jiah's mother Rabia Khan discovered her daughter hanging from the ceiling of her home in Mumbai's Juhu neighbourhood. The Juhu Police detained actor Suraj Pancholi, Jiah Khan's then-boyfriend, for aiding suicide after a 6-page letter allegedly written by Jiah was discovered at her home. It was asserted that the suicide letter was evidence against Suraj and that it represented their turbulent relationship.

Anurag Kashyap says Nawazuddin Siddiqui is “extremely misjudged and misconstrued person”; lauds Haddi co-star,"Renowned filmmaker Anurag Kashyap recently shared some heartfelt insights about actor Nawazudding Siddiqui in a candid interview.

"Pooja Bhatt On That Viral Kiss With Dad Mahesh Bhatt: ""It Was Absolutely Innocent""","Image shared on Instagram. (Courtesy: poojab1972 ) Actress Pooja Bhatt, who was last seen as a contestant in Bigg Boss OTT season 2, in a recent interview with Siddharth Kannan , spoke at length about the unwarranted attention that was given to the magazine cover in 1990 where she was seen kissing her dad Mahesh Bhatt on the lips. Elaborating on the issues, the Bombay Begums star asserted that the moment that was captured was ""absolutely innocent."" On being asked if she regrets the photo shoot, Pooja Bhatt was quick to reply, ""No, because I see it very simple, and I think that unfortunately jo hota hai (what happens is), a frozen moment can be represented and misrepresented in anyway. Aur mujhe yaad hai Shah Rukh ne mujhe yeh kaha tha when you have daughters, jab hi aapke bacche chote hai (I remember Shah Rukh had told me that when you have daughters and when your child is small), how often a child just says, ‘Mummy papa give me a kiss'. And they go this way. Main ab bhi is umar mein bhi wahi 10 pound ki bacchi hoon for my father. Vo jindagi bher wahi rahege for me (At this age also I am still a 10 pound child for my father. He will always remain that way for me)."" Calling out the media for viewing the picture in an inappropriate way, Pooja Bhatt further said, ""So it was a moment that was absolutely innocent which was captured. Aur uske connotation jo hai, jinko padhna hai vo padhge, jinko dekhna hai vo dekhege. Aur main is cheej ko defend karne nahi baithi. Agar log baap aur beti ke rishte ko alag najariye se dekh sakte hai toh vo kuch bhi kar sakte hai. Fir hum baat karte hai family values ki. Bahut kamal ka joke hai (Whatever its connotations, people may read it as they want, they will see it as they wish I cannot defend it here. If you want to see the relation between a father and a daughter in a different way then you can do anything. And then we talk about family values. What an amazing joke)."" While in Bigg Boss House, Pooja Bhatt was visited by her dad Mahesh Bhatt, who shared several anecdotes from his life. He also opened up about how Pooja became the bread earner in his family during tough times. He revealed that during his struggling phase, Pooja stepped up and became the backbone of the family. She took the initiative to pursue a modelling career and auditioned for numerous ads. Her efforts and success in the modelling world played a crucial role in running the household during those difficult days. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com In another episode of Bigg Boss OTT 2 , Pooja Bhatt discussed her equation with her former husband. “He is a very good human being, he's Capricorn and that's why we got along very well. When we start speaking a lie, the blame game starts and I didn't want that. Whatever was there was very good till the time it lasted. Till the time dignity was there we were together. Then we parted ways on a good note,” she said. They were married from 2003 to 2014. Pooja is Mahesh Bhatt's daughter with Kiran Bhatt Aka Lorraine Bright who he married in 1970.

Do not want to give tension to CM when she will be travelling abroad: Bengal Governor CV Ananda Bose,"Synopsis Kolkata Governor CV Ananda Bose has refused to disclose the contents of two ""confidential"" letters he sent to the Centre and the state government. Bose stated that he does not want Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to be stressed during her official trip to Spain. He plans to discuss the matter with her upon her return. The governor sent the sealed letters following a dispute over his appointment of officiating vice-chancellors to various universities. Bose also addressed allegations that he has not cleared bills, stating that he has sent seven out of eight bills to the respective departments for clarification. PTI West Bengal Governor CV Ananda Bose KOLKATA: West Bengal Governor CV Ananda Bose on Monday declined to divulge details of the two ""confidential"" letters he sent to the Centre and the state government two days ago and said he does not want Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to carry any stress during her scheduled official tour to Spain. Bose said he would discuss the matter with the chief minister after her return from the tour. ""What is confidential should remain confidential. I am the sender, the recipient would react to it. I wanted to communicate something. Whatever has been sent to the state, this is not the time to discuss, because my constitutional colleague the chief minister is going abroad and I do not want any tension to be given to her. ""Let her not take any baggage with her when she is on a foreign tour. We will discuss it once she returns,"" Bose told reporters at the Raj Bhavan here. The governor sent the two sealed letters to the Centre and the state government in the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday, following an intense war of words between the two sides over his appointing officiating vice-chancellors to various universities. State Education Minister Bratya Basu did not react to the sealed letters sent by the Raj Bhavan. However, minutes after Bose's warning of a much bigger action at midnight, Basu had on Saturday reacted to the comment and mocked the governor by calling him the ""new vampire in town"". On Basu's 'vampire' remarks, the governor said, ""I won't comment on what my junior colleague has said."" Incidentally, sources in the Raj Bhavan said Bose had on Sunday written another letter to Banerjee, which ""was just a routine one"". Talking about the state government's allegations that the governor was not clearing bills, Bose said that he has sent seven, out of eight bills, to respective departments for ""certain clarifications"". ""In respect of all seven (bills), I have sought certain clarifications and sent them to the respective government departments. These are pending with the government, not with the Raj Bhavan. ""One bill is pending ...(as). Whatever is subjudice cannot be acted upon without the final decisions of the courts,"" he said. Asked about when permanent vice-chancellors will be appointed to universities in the state, Bose said, ""It's a long process. There is an assessment and selection committee that should be constituted on the basis Supreme Court's decision and based on the UGC regulations. Only then, regular VCs can be posted. Till then interim VCs will be there. For interim VCs, no professional qualification is needed. Any eligible or suitable person can be appointed as VC. That is a rule and that is how it is done."" The governor, in his capacity as the chancellor of state-run universities, recently appointed interim vice-chancellors for eight varsities, including the prestigious Presidency University, MAKAUT and the University of Burdwan, a step which was severely criticised by the chief minister as a bid to interfere in the running of state-administered universities. Sources said the interim vice-chancellors of eight other universities have also been finalised and appointment letters ""will be issued soon"". Speaking on academicians staging demonstrations near the Raj Bhavan, Bose said, ""Protest is a very refined way of democratic function. Anybody can protest but it should be within the limits of socially accepted norms."" Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories! Get your daily dose of business updates on WhatsApp. click here!

"TMC to go to Rajghat to pray on Oct 2, if permission to protest not granted: Mamata Banerjee","Synopsis West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee criticized the central government for its ""vendetta politics"" and threatened to hold a protest at Rajghat if permission was denied. She also condemned the summons sent by the Enforcement Directorate to her nephew and TMC leader, Abhishek Banerjee, in connection with a school jobs scam and a case related to cow smuggling. PTI West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee Lashing out at the central government for what she termed its ""vendetta politics"", West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee asserted on Monday that her partymen would pray at Rajghat , if permission to protest there on Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary was denied. She also denounced the summons sent by the Centre's Enforcement Directorate to her nephew and TMC leader Abhishek Banerjee accused in the school jobs scam as well as in another case related to cow smuggling, and termed it as a bid to ""browbeat a youth leader"". The Trinamool Congress supremo who has been engaged in a war of words with the state's Governor C V Ananda Bose over various issues, however, made light of missives sent by him to the state government and her, stating that he had simply sent her ""best wishes for the upcoming foreign trip."" Banerjee on Tuesday is embarking on a visit to Dubai and Spain to seek investments. ""I am going abroad after 5 years; no permission was given for foreign travels earlier, though I had several invitations,"" Banerjee said. ""Delhi police is not our enemy, but they will not be able to give us permission to protest at Rajghat as that will be a political call... However, we can still go there to pray, that is always permissible,"" Banerjee told a press conference here. The TMC had sought permission to protest against non-release of NREGA dues to Bengal, in large numbers at three venues in Delhi including the Rajghat where Gandhi's ashes are kept.

INDIA bloc constituents want to destroy Sanatan Hindu dharma: Goa CM Pramod Sawant,"Synopsis ""Mughal rulers like Babar, the British and the Portuguese, who came to Goa with the agenda of forced conversion, had tried to eradicate the Sanatan Hindu religion, but all of them failed. Now, the partners of the INDIA alliance together want to erase the Sanatan Dharma,"" Sawant told a press conference here. Goa CM Pramod Sawant Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant on Monday alleged that members of the opposition INDIA alliance want to erase the Sanatan Hindu religion which withstood such attempts made in the past by Mughal rulers, the British and the Portuguese. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader's remarks came amid a political row after Tamil Nadu minister Udhayanidhi Stalin, who belongs to DMK, blamed Sanatan Dharma for promoting division and discrimination among people and called for its eradication. Also, DMK leader A Raja had likened Sanatan Dharma to diseases like leprosy and HIV which had social stigma. ""Mughal rulers like Babar, the British and the Portuguese, who came to Goa with the agenda of forced conversion, had tried to eradicate the Sanatan Hindu religion, but all of them failed. Now, the partners of the INDIA alliance together want to erase the Sanatan Dharma,"" Sawant told a press conference here. He also said it would be appropriate if people belonging to the Sanatan Hindu religion drive away these parties. ""Leaders of the INDIA bloc are constantly using abusive language about Sanatan Dharma. Insulting Sanatan Hindu Dharma is the policy of this alliance,"" Sawant alleged. He said though the name of the United Progressive Alliance has been changed to the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), their policies and work remain the same, and people are aware of the true nature of these parties. Sawant also took a swipe at Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray who has claimed that a large number of people from across the country are expected to gather for the inauguration of Ram temple in Ayodhya but a ""Godhra-like incident"" may occur during their return journey. ""I don't know why Thackeray has any apprehension regarding the inauguration ceremony of Ram temple. You (the media) should question him about this,"" Sawant added. He hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership, saying India has organised the most successful G20 summit and ensured consensus from various nations on the joint declaration. ""The success of the G20 summit is a matter of pride for India,"" he added. Sawant denied that Christians are migrating from Goa. ""People belonging to the Christian community are not migrating from Goa because there is no need for them to do so. A section of people is moving to countries in Europe and other continents for employment,"" he added. Replying to a query, Sawant said he was proud that the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) has been followed in the coastal state since its liberation from the Portuguese in 1961. ""Goa is definitely a role model for other states in terms of UCC. It is necessary for other states also to implement the UCC,"" he added. HWP ADU NSK Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

Updated Asia Cup Super 4 Points Table After India's Big Win Over Pakistan,"Kuldeep Yadav registered a five-wicket haul while Virat Kohli and KL Rahul smashed unbeaten centuries as India outplayed Pakistan by 228 runs in the Asia Cup 2023 Super 4 match in Colombo on Monday. The game that started on Sunday but was moved to the reserve day due to rain eventually saw India finishing on a high with the bat as well as the ball. Resuming at the score of 147 for 2 in 24.1 overs on Monday with Kohli and Rahul at the crease, India posted a daunting total of 356 for 2 in 50 overs against Pakistan. Kohli scored 122 not out while Rahul hit unbeaten 111 to steer India to the big total. Only if India's dominance in the game lacked anything, Kuldeep returned with figures of 5 for 25. After the big victory, India rose to the top spot in the Asia Cup 2023 Super 4 table. They have two points to their credit but a superb net run rate (NRR) of +4.560 has put them at helm. On the other hand, Pakistan slipped to the number three spot with an NRR of -1.892. Sri Lanka are at the second spot with an NRR of +0.420 while Bangladesh are at the bottom place in the four-team table with an NRR of -0.749. Here is the updated table: Talking about the game, Kohli's supreme fitness was evident in his 47th ODI century while comeback man Rahul produced an equally engaging ton on comeback as India thrashed a listless Pakistan by record 228-run margin in the rain-marred contest. This is India's biggest win in terms of runs against the cross-border neighbours. India posted an imposing 356 for 2, as Kohli (122 not out off 94 balls) and Rahul (111 not out off 106 balls), which was his sixth ODI hundred, pummelled a hapless Pakistan, whose chase ended at 128 for 8 as Kuldeep Yadav (5/25) scythed through them.

"IND Vs PAK, Innings Highlights: India Flex Batting Muscle In Asia Cup Super Four Clash Against Pakistan","googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); IND Vs PAK, Innings Highlights: India posted a massive 356/2 batting first in the Asia Cup 2023 Super Fours fixture at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Monday. While Rohit Sharma (56 off 49) and Shubman Gill (58 off 52 balls) had put on a 121-run stand for the first wicket, KL Rahul and Virat Kohli took it on from there and added an unbeaten 233 runs for the second wicket off 194 balls. Both Rahul and Kohli smashed hundreds with Kohli remaining not out on 122 off 94 deliveries. Rahul, meanwhile, also stayed till the end of the innings and ended up with 111 runs from 106 balls. While Pakistan had won the toss and invited India to bat first on Sunday (September 10), only 24.1 overs were made possible on the first day after which persistent rains made no play possible. However, with the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) announcing a Reserve Day for the much-anticipated encounter, the match was pushed to the extra day with no reduction in overs and Rahul and Kohli resumed India's innings from 147/2. The two batters took their time early on Monday but once they got their eye in, they unleased their range of strokes and they put on an unbeaten 233-run stand off 194 deliveries. It was a special innings from Rahul who was playing his first competitive match after returning from a long injury layoff. Moreover, Rahul was expected to miss this match but a last minute injury to Shreyas Iyer meant the management was forced to include Rahul in the Playing XI. As far as Pakistan are concerned, the Men in Green only mangaed to take two wickets. Shadab Khan got the wicket of Rohit Sharma while Shaheen Shah Afridi removed Shubman Gill with a slower ball. The two batters departed in a space of 8 balls and this was the only phase of the innings that Pakistan dominated barring which it was all about India. It didn't help Pakistan's case either than Haris Rauf did not take the field on Monday as a precautionary measure due to a side strain.",sports
"IND vs PAK: Virat Kohli Becomes Fastest To 13,000 ODI Runs","India's run-machine Virat Kohli became the fastest to score 13,000 runs in One Day Internationals (ODIs). He achieved the feat during India's Asia Cup 2023, Super Fours encounter against Pakistan, at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Monday (September 11). The right-handed batter reached to the milestone in his 278th ODI in what happens to be his 267th innings in this format. While the match was scheduled to take place on September 10, the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) kept a reserve day in provision for this match and as it turned out, the match did seep into the reserve day with rain making only 24.1 overs of play possible on the first day. Talking about India's innings, it was a sensational batting performance from them with each of their top four batters scoring at least a half-century. While Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill scored half-centuries, Kohli and KL Rahul smashed hundreds. Also on ABP LIVE: IND vs PAK, Asia Cup 2023 Super Fours- LIVE UPDATES It was a night where Kohli broke several records.

While Rahul's 111* included 12 fours and two sixes, Kohli's 122* was studded with 9 fours and 2 sixes, including a maximum off the final ball of the innings as India finished with a massive 356/2 on the reserve day of this match. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); });",sports

Ukraine Claims It Recaptured Oil And Gas Platforms Near Russia-Annexed Crimea,"New Delhi: Ukraine's military intelligence (GUR) on Monday said that Kyiv's forces have regained control from Russia of several gas and oil offshore drilling platforms close to Crimea, news agency Reuters said. In a message posted on the Telegram messaging app, it said that Ukraine's forces had retaken the drilling platforms known as the ""Boiko Towers"" in a ""unique operation"". According to Reuters, the military intelligence authorities said the platforms had been occupied since 2015 by Russia, which seized and annexed Crimea in 2014, and had been used by Moscow for military purposes since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. ""For Ukraine, regaining control of the Boiko Towers was of strategic importance and, as a result, Russia lost the ability to use them for military purposes,"" GUR said in a video posted on Telegram. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); ""Russia has been deprived of the ability to fully control the waters of the Black Sea, and this makes Ukraine many steps closer to regaining Crimea,"" it further stated. Russia, however, didn't comment on the report. According to GUR, during the operation, there was a clash between Ukrainian special forces on boats and a Russian fighter jet, which was damaged and forced to retreat. GUR also captured other ""valuable trophies"" such as helicopter munitions and a radar system that can track the movement of ships in the Black Sea, it said. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian soldiers today searched for the bodies of Russian soldiers in Blahodatne as they hoped to exchange for their own comrades, living and dead. They called it the ""road of death"" after the number of Russian soldiers killed there when Ukrainian forces retook the southeastern village of Blahodatne at the start of their counteroffensive in June. ""Here's what we do. We gather up their bodies. We arrange exchanges for our prisoners who are alive. And for bodies. Our boys,"" Vasylii, a 53-year-old volunteer, said. ""You know, so that a mother can go and visit the cemetery."" Russia and Ukraine have conducted regular exchanges of prisoners of war, as well as the bodies of dead soldiers, since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.",world

Jumping on Arm's blockbuster IPO could be a risky business for retail investors,"Synopsis While dabbling in individual stocks is a notoriously risky business for amateur investors, an analysis underscores just how perilous it can be to buy into blockbuster IPOs on Day One. Reuters Retail traders getting their first bite at Arm Holdings' highly anticipated public offering when the British chip designer begins trading this week should beware: individual investors often get burned when they jump on hot listings. Arm's goal of raising around $5 billion in New York in what might be the biggest IPO of 2023 follows other major listings in recent years whose returns have mostly disappointed. Elevate Your Tech Process with High-Value Skill Courses Offering College Course Website Indian School of Business ISB Applied Business Analytics Visit Indian School of Business ISB Digital Transformation Visit Northwestern University Kellogg Post Graduate Certificate in Product Management Visit Indian School of Business ISB Product Management Visit Since Arm, owned by Japan's SoftBank Group's, is not well-known among consumers, it is focusing its IPO marketing efforts on institutional investors, people familiar with the deal said. That leaves most Main Street investors to buy Arm shares at potentially higher prices once they begin trading. With retail investors holding individual stocks for less than a year on average, recent history suggests they could lose money, a Reuters analysis shows. The 10 biggest US initial public offerings (IPOs) of the past four years are down an average of 47% from the closing price on their first day of trading, according to the analysis of LSEG data as of Friday. Investors who bought at the top of an intra-day price surge that often occurs in high-profile listings would have fared even worse, with an average loss of 53%. Only two of the stocks in those top 10 are up from their IPO prices: software seller Snowflake and Airbnb, which leads with a 111% return. Discover the stories of your interest Blockchain 5 Stories Cyber-safety 7 Stories Fintech 9 Stories E-comm 9 Stories ML 8 Stories Edtech 6 Stories While dabbling in individual stocks is a notoriously risky business for amateur investors, the analysis underscores just how perilous it can be to buy into blockbuster IPOs on Day One. Even institutional investors invited to buy into those 10 IPOs before trading would be down an average of 18%. The S&P 500 has gained an average of 13% since each of those IPOs, nine of which happened in 2020 and 2021. ""If you're buying in the market, on average, you're buying at a premium to the offer price,"" said Jay Ritter, a professor at the University of Florida who studies IPOs. ""For almost all retail investors, buying and holding a low-cost index fund is the best strategy."" Arm's debut and an upcoming listing from grocery delivery service Instacart are expected to rejuvenate a lackluster IPO market which has slowed over the past two years due to volatility and economic uncertainty. Instacart will be offering some retail investors a chance to buy into its IPO via underwriter fintech company SoFi, its prospectus said. On Monday, SoFi notified customers it would be offering a ""limited number of shares"" in the Arm IPO too. While Arm is a business-to-business company with little consumer brand recognition, its IPO publicity is likely to attract retail interest, said analysts. Nvidia, the chipmaker at the center of an artificial intelligence boom, has been a retail favorite this year. Retail participation in US stocks surged in 2021, fueled by low interest rates, zero-cost trading apps, and social media hype around GameStop and other so-called meme stocks. But Main Street investors have become more cautious after last year's stock market sell-off, said Marco Iachini, a senior vice president at Vanda Research, which tracks retail trades. ""Whatever comes out of the Arm IPO, you'll see niches of the retail community trying to get in on it, but it's not going to be at the levels we saw in some of the IPOs in 2021,"" he said. Spokespeople for Arm and SoFi declined to comment. Spokespeople for Instacart and the 10 companies whose IPOs were analyzed did not provide comment, or did not respond to comment requests. Crushed valuations Arm is seeking up to $51 per share, potentially valuing it at more than $50 billion - the most valuable company to list in New York since electric carmaker Rivian Automotive debuted in 2021. Burning through cash to ramp up production, Rivian's market value has collapsed by over $60 billion since it listed. Also among the biggest IPOs in recent years, food delivery company DoorDash's stock remains down by more than half from its intraday high on its December 2020 debut. To be sure, it has been a tough few years for IPOs. Wall Street's steep sell-off in 2022, along with rising interest rates and fears of a potential US recession, have crushed valuations of companies that went public before they were profitable. But studies by Ritter and others have shown IPOs offer poor returns. In the past four years, over 260 IPOs have debuted with stock market values above $1 billion, mostly in the technology, healthcare and consumer discretionary sectors, according to LSEG. They are down on average 29% from their offering prices and down 49% from their initial trading highs. One standout among recent big IPOs is chipmaker GlobalFoundries, which has gained 23% since its 2021 listing, compared to the S&P 500's 3% dip over that time. Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

"Week 2 takeaways: Miami, Florida State heating things up in ACC","Two weeks into the college football season, we're seeing some old powers show signs of rising again. Florida State, Texas and Penn State are looking like potential playoff contenders, while Miami is making some noise as well. Meanwhile, Texas A&M was on the short end against the Hurricanes, part of a surprisingly slow start for the powerful SEC. Our college football reporters take a closer look at what we learned in Week 2. Glory days in Florida? Florida State and Miami are both good and nationally relevant at the same time? It might be early, but this would be a huge development not only for college football but for the ACC, which has needed both teams to get back to their respective glory days for the good of the conference. What has stood out is the way both teams completely controlled their SEC opponents. That's right, the ACC has had the upper hand in the early-season matchups, going 4-1. It brings new meaning to #goacc. Florida State and Miami happen to have the two most impressive wins. The Seminoles showed the swagger we expect from an FSU team in a Week 1 win over LSU in which they relished breaking the Tigers' will. Miami showed the same type of physicality and dominance in a 48-33 win over Texas A&M on Saturday, a huge step forward in changing the narrative around the program. Miami might not quite be where Florida State is now, but the Hurricanes are very clearly believing in what Mario Cristobal is preaching. The way they won that game -- in contrast to the slog of a loss to A&M last year -- is proof of their progress. Given the issues we've seen with Clemson and North Carolina, it's not so hard to imagine a scenario in which Miami and Florida State end up in the ACC championship game -- a dream matchup the league has longed to see. -- Andrea Adelson Jimbo still has work to do Texas A&M coach Jimbo Fisher, who received a guaranteed 10-year contract extension before the 2021 season that will pay him $95 million through 2031, lost to Miami on Saturday. The Aggies are paying Fisher $95 million NOT to lose ... to anyone. And two games into his sixth season at College Station, Fisher has lost 22 times. What was so striking about Saturday's decisive loss to the Hurricanes is that it's evident the Aggies are better than they were during last year's 5-7 season -- and yet it still wasn't good enough against a Miami program that is still ""building,"" as coach Mario Cristobal described it. The good news for Texas A&M? Alabama and LSU have already lost, too, which means the SEC West is up for grabs. The bad news? The Aggies won't win it if they continue to lose the turnover battle, can't pressure the quarterback and can't sustain a lead. -- Heather Dinich Is the SEC broken? For the first time since 2002, according to ESPN Stats & Information, Alabama, Florida and LSU all have a loss by the end of Week 2. LSU fell by three touchdowns 45-24 to Florida State in Orlando, Florida, in Week 1. Texas handed the Crimson Tide a 34-24 loss Saturday night, their first double-digit defeat under coach Nick Saban and his first as a college head coach since 2003. While it might have been less surprising, the Gators fell at Utah by 13 and couldn't even get the correct number of players on the field in their opener. Texas A&M lost 48-33 at Miami on Saturday, and Vanderbilt fell 36-20 to Wake Forest. Two-time defending national champion Georgia is still No. 1, but the rest of the SEC looks rather ordinary. It could have been even worse for the SEC on Saturday. Tennessee led by only 7 at the half against FCS program Austin Peay before pulling away for a 30-13 victory. Ole Miss won 37-20 at Tulane, which played without star quarterback Michael Pratt. The Rebels scored 10 points in the final two minutes, including a 56-yard field goal. Kentucky trailed FCS program Eastern Kentucky in the third quarter before finally getting things together in a 28-17 victory. Missouri beat Middle Tennessee State by 4, Mississippi State defeated Arizona by 7 in overtime (after getting a defensive stop inches from a first down on fourth-and-10 on the final play of the game), and Auburn survived by 4 at California, which missed three field goals. It might mean more in the SEC, as the slogan goes, but it might mean a lot less for its teams in December if things don't turn around. -- Mark Schlabach The Pac-12 leftovers are ready to play spoiler Colorado might be the sport's attention magnet right now, but elsewhere in the dying Pac-12, its two remaining constituents continue to impress. During a week when both Oregon State and Washington State took legal action against the conference and commissioner George Kliavkoff, the schools' football teams had impressive performances. After taking care of UC Davis at home with ease and outscoring their first two opponents 97-24 through two games, Oregon State sits at No. 16 in the AP poll. Meanwhile, unranked Washington State won't be unranked much longer after taking down No. 18 Wisconsin in Pullman. While Oregon, USC and Utah continue to be the favorites for the conference title and a potential playoff spot, all three of those teams will have to face at least one of the Cougars and Beavers, if not both, on their way to trying to accomplish their goals. There will be no shortage of motivation in those games for the Cougars and Beavers, who will be left behind as their conference mates flee to the Big Ten and Big 12 next season. As Wazzu head coach Jake Dickert proclaimed after the win Saturday, the Cougars ""belong in a Power 5"" and both they and Oregon State seem to be intent on reminding everyone of that. -- Paolo Uggetti Texas gets over the hump I'm not going to sit here and write that Texas is back. That's no certainty after only two games. But something seemed appropriate about the Longhorns beating Alabama on Saturday night. It seemed a little bit like they were exorcising their demons. Because in some ways it was the Crimson Tide that started Texas' down slide in the 2009 BCS national championship game. Mack Brown couldn't turn things around when they went south after that. Neither could Tom Herman or Charlie Strong. And yet there was Strong on the sideline in Bryant-Denny Stadium as a member of Alabama's support staff, congratulating Longhorns super fan Matthew McConaughey. And there was Steve Sarkisian, who said it felt like a ""full circle"" moment, returning to Tuscaloosa, where Nick Saban resurrected his career and paved the way for him to become Texas' head coach. Sarkisian's athletic director, Chris Del Conte, said moments like Saturday's postgame celebration were why he hired Sarkisian -- for that offense and for his ability to recruit. It has been a long time since Texas could go toe-to-toe with a team like Alabama, but the Horns had the better quarterback in Quinn Ewers and the better receivers in Xavier Worthy, Adonai Mitchell and Jordan Whittington. They had the more complete team. ""You can tell we're starting to get our footing,"" Del Conte said. ""It's nowhere near a finished product, but it's pretty fun to be where we're at today."" -- Alex Scarborough Iowa's offense has subtle signs of hope Iowa might not average 25 points per game to meet offensive coordinator Brian Ferentz's amended contract. The Hawkeyes have only 44 in two games, 37 from the offense. But they're undeniably better than the historically poor unit we saw last season, and there are indicators of improvement as the games go by. Redshirt freshman running back Jaziun Patterson provides a different element, as he showed with a 59-yard breakaway against Iowa State. Patterson can be used beyond short-yardage situations to complement Kaleb Johnson. ""I'm a downhill runner,"" Patterson said. ""They say I run wild. I run with a purpose. Every time you see me run the ball, I'm running the ball hard."" Ferentz can diversify his play calls with a more experienced unit. The next step is to hit on more chunk plays, as Diante Vines and others got behind Iowa State's defense Saturday, but quarterback Cade McNamara couldn't connect. ""We're growing,"" coach Kirk Ferentz said. ""The thing I'm probably most excited about is we have a lot of potential to continue to grow."" -- Adam Rittenberg Patience pays off for Penn State On the surface, Penn State did what it was expected to do against Delaware. Its offense scored on eight of its 11 possessions in a 63-7 rout, including the first four times it had the ball -- all on rushing touchdowns (three from Nicholas Singleton and one from Kaytron Allen). But consider this as the competition gets stiffer for the Nittany Lions, with their annual White Out game coming in two weeks against Iowa: Six of those scoring drives lasted at least eight plays, and two went at least 10 plays (a 13-play, 60-yard drive in the first quarter and a 10-play, 74-yard drive on the opening possession of the second half). Penn State also won the time of possession battle 42:22 to 17:38. That type of ball control behind its two stellar sophomore running backs, Singleton and Allen, could go a long way toward determining Penn State's fortunes in the Big Ten East and beyond. -- Blake Baumgartner Nebraska's quarterback situation is a mess First-year Nebraska coach Matt Rhule is already at a crossroads. Through two games, it's clear the Huskers won't be competitive with Jeff Sims at quarterback. He threw three picks in the 13-10 loss to Minnesota in the opener and was even worse against Colorado on Saturday in Boulder, where the offense had difficulty executing at even a basic, foundational level. Given there is no threat to move the ball through the air when Sims is in the game, Nebraska's one-dimensional offense has become all too easy to prepare for, and the run game will surely suffer as a result. The tough part about situations like this is that we have to operate under the assumption Sims outplayed Heinrich Haarberg and Chubba Purdy to win the job, which -- if true -- doesn't exactly inspire confidence in the idea things will change if either one of them takes over the starting job. With games against Northern Illinois and Louisiana Tech the next two weeks, Rhule has a little bit of runway to find a solution before Big Ten play, but the clock is ticking. -- Kyle Bonagura",sports
U.S. approves updated COVID vaccines to rev up protection this fall,"The U.S. approved updated COVID-19 vaccines Monday, hoping to rev up protection against the latest coronavirus strains and blunt any surge this fall and winter. The Food and Drug Administration decision opens the newest shots from Moderna and Pfizer and its partner BioNTech to most Americans even if they’ve never had a coronavirus vaccination. It’s part of a shift to treat fall updates of the COVID-19 vaccine much like getting a yearly flu shot. There’s still another step: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must sign off. A CDC advisory panel is set to issue recommendations Tuesday on who most needs the updated shots. Vaccinations could begin later this week, and both the COVID-19 and flu shot can be given at the same visit. A third vaccine maker, Novavax, said its updated shot is still being reviewed by the FDA. COVID-19 hospitalizations have been rising since late summer although –- thanks to lasting immunity from prior vaccinations and infections –- not nearly as much as this time last year. But protection wanes over time and the coronavirus continually churns out new variants that can dodge prior immunity. It’s been a year since the last time the vaccines were tweaked, and only about 20% of adults ever received that earlier update. “Vaccination remains critical to public health and continued protection against serious consequences of COVID-19, including hospitalization and death,” FDA vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks said in a statement. “We very much encourage those who are eligible to consider getting vaccinated.” Just like earlier vaccinations, the fall round is cleared for adults and children as young as age 6 months. FDA said starting at age 5, most people can get a single dose even if they’ve never had a prior COVID-19 shot. Younger children might need additional doses depending on their history of COVID-19 infections and vaccinations. The FDA pointedly isn’t calling this latest round a “booster” but instead a vaccine updated to better match the currently circulating virus. The new recipe targets an omicron variant named XBB.1.5 — replacing outdated combination vaccines that mixed protection against the original coronavirus strain and an older version of omicron. And while even the XBB.1.5 variant is no longer dominant, FDA determined that it’s close enough to coronavirus strains causing most COVID-19 illnesses today to offer good cross-protection. Like earlier versions, they're expected to be most protective against COVID-19's worst consequences rather than mild infection. But while the FDA's decision allows for wide use of the updated shots, the CDC will decide how strongly different groups are urged to get them. Federal officials have said the shots still will be free to most Americans through private insurance or Medicare. But for the uninsured or underinsured, the CDC is working with health departments, clinics and certain pharmacies to temporarily provide free shots.",world
Hey Presto! Nvidia pulls software hack out of AI hat and doubles performance of H100 GPU for free,"Nvidia is banding together with a list of tech partners on a game-changing piece of software that’s set to double the performance of its flagship H100 Tensor Core GPUs. The open source TensorRT-LLM update, which is set for release in the coming weeks, sees an up-to-date system outperform the A100 by eightfold, whereas H100s would previously outperform the A100 by just fourfold. This was tested on the GPT-J 6B, a model that’s used to summarise articles from CNN and Daily Mail. When tested on Meta’s Llama2 LLM, TensorRT-LLM-powered H100s outperformed A100s by 4.6 times – versus 2.6 times before the update. The versatility and dynamism of large language models (LLMs) can make it difficult to batch requests and execute them in parallel, which means some requests finish much earlier than others. To solve this, Nvidia and its partners embedded TensorRT-LLM with a more powerful scheduling technique called in-flight batching. This takes advantage of the fact text generation can be broken down into multiple subtasks. Put simply, instead of waiting for an entire batch of tasks from one request to finish before moving on to the next request, the system can continue processing new batches from different requests in parallel. TensorRT-LLM comprises a TensorRT deep learning compiler and includes optimized kernels, pre-processing and post-processing steps, as well as multi-GPU and multi-node communication primitives. The result? Groundbreaking performance on Nvidia’s GPUs paving the way for new large language model experimentation, quick customization, and peak performance. This software uses tensor parallelism, in which individual weight matrices are split across devices, in turn, allowing efficient inference at scale; each model runs in parallel across multiple GPUs and across multiple servers. TensorRT-LLM also includes fully optimized and read-to-run versions of popular LLMs including Llama 2, GPT-2 and GPT-3 , as well as Falcon, Mosaic MPT, BLOOM, and dozens of others. These can be accessed through a Python API. The update is available in early access, and will soon be integrated into the Nvidia NeMo framework, which is part of Nvidia AI Enterprise. Researchers can access this through the NeMo framework, the NGC portal, or through the source repository on GitHub.",technology
"The Surface Duo gets the worst birthday present, as Microsoft drops support","Three years after the Surface Duo launched on September 10, 2020, Microsoft announced that it would drop official software support for the device. However, this should come as no surprise to those who read the Surface Duo support page, as Microsoft clearly outlined on it that the device would only receive Android version and security updates for three years after its launch. Starting from now forward, the tech giant will not be sending out OS updates and security patches, making Android 12L the last version. On top of that, the Surface Duo only truly received two major updates, which is even lower than what Android devices get on average. But it seems that Microsoft hasn’t been releasing any smaller updates like bug fixes or new features over the years either. Luckily, there’s third-party support, which allows you to install a custom version of Android 13/14 on the Surface Duo devices. It's something that makes one of the best phones even better. As for the Surface Duo 2 , Microsoft will offer support until October 21, 2024, which so far has only received a single update since its release. The Surface Duo isn’t the only thing losing support, as Microsoft also recently announced that it would end third-party printer support over the next several years. But unlike the Surface Duo, printer support will instead switch to first-party which makes the best printers far more accessible to users. However, that’s not the case with this Surface Duo situation. Looking at it, only three years of support is absolutely atrocious, and it seems that Microsoft didn’t even give proper one during those three years based on the lack of smaller-scale updates over the years. This three-year cycle seems to now be the standard in terms of Android devices, but the tech giant doesn’t even seem to abide by that. The original Surface Duo only received two major updates, and the Surface Duo 2 has only gotten a single major update with one year remaining for official support. Another anti-consumer action Microsoft has taken is killing off Windows 11 troubleshooters , which were sometimes helpful tools that diagnosed processes, automatically identified common Windows problems, and then resolved them. This was a baked-in Windows OS feature since Windows 7 , which will be phased out over the next several years. Seeing Microsoft engage in such behavior is disappointing to say the least, especially considering all the issues that Windows 11 already has . We reached out to Microsoft for comment on the matter and will update this article once we receive a statement.",technology
"Over 10,000 More Jobs To Go At UK Household Goods Company Wilko","Wilko had earlier announced its collapse in August, putting 12,500 jobs at risk. More than 10,000 staff will lose their jobs at struggling UK household goods retailer Wilko, administrators said Monday, after last-ditch talks on a rescue deal with the owner of the HMV music store chain collapsed. Canadian businessman Doug Putman had been in talks with administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to buy some 200 shops operated by Wilko, which went bust in August. But both Putman and PwC said that those discussions to rescue it as a going concern had reached an end -- despite having backing from Wilko management, staff and PwC -- as it was revealed that as many as 10,196 extra employees face the axe. PwC had already announced in recent weeks that more than 1,600 staff would be made redundant. ""The joint administrators have explored all potential opportunities to save the business,"" PwC said in a statement on Monday. ""However, despite extensive efforts, it has become clear that no significant part of the Wilko operations can be rescued as a going concern. ""As a result, the joint administrators have today informed all staff that they will sadly commence the closure of all Wilko stores, the two distribution centres and the cessation of the majority of activities of the support centre."" The statement noted that all shops are set to be closed by early October, resulting in 9,100 redundancies of store employees. Distribution centre operations are expected to shutter on Friday, with ""the majority"" of its 886 remaining employees made redundant then. Further lay-offs of 210 remaining support centre staff will also occur before early October as operations wind down, administrators said. - 'Disappointment' - B&M European Value Retail has agreed a £13-million ($16.3-million) deal to buy 51 Wilko stores, but without saying how jobs in those operations would be affected. Those stores will also close and reopen under B&M's branding, according to administrators. Wilko, which operated some 400 stores across the UK and online, announced its collapse on August 10, putting 12,500 jobs at risk. It blamed stubbornly high inflation and interest rates affecting businesses and consumers. Hopes had been resting on a last-gasp deal with Putman, but he confirmed separately Monday that that would not be happening. ""It is with great disappointment that we can no longer continue in the purchase process for Wilko,"" the businessman said in a statement. ""We had financing in place and received the full support of PwC, Wilko management and staff representatives. ""A stable foundation could not be secured to ensure long-term success for the business and its people in the way that we would have wanted."" A source familiar with the matter confirmed to AFP that administrators were also in discussions with low-cost retailers Poundland and Home Bargains over a possible partial rescue deal. But those talks also failed. In its latest update, PwC said staff at 124 stores were informed Monday that those outlets will close on or before September 21, while timings for the closure of the remaining 222 stores would be announced ""in due course"". The GMB union's general secretary Gary Smith said there were ""thousands of families across the UK who are going to be impacted by this terrible decision."" Earlier the union's national officer Nadine Houghton had claimed that the firm, which was founded in 1930 in central England, had been ""run into the ground"" and staff were suffering the consequences. Leader of the Britain's opposition Labour party, Keir Starmer, also criticised the move on X, formerly known as Twitter. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com ""Devastating for staff and their families and another symptom of Tory Britain,"" he said, referring to the Conservative party which has held power in Britain for the last 13 years.

Lehar Khan on working with Shah Rukh Khan in Jawan: Beyond my imagination,"Lehar Khan, the youngest actor of Shah Rukh Khan 's Jawan opened up about her experience on the sets, with Hindustan Times. Not only this, she also talked about the difficult phase in her life when she almost gave up her acting career. Lehar plays Kalki, one of Azad’s six girls in the film, alongside Sanjeeta Bhattacharya, Sanya Malhotra, Priyamani, Girija Oak and Aaliyah Qureishi. Actor Lehar Khan is a big fan of Shah Rukh Khan. Also read: Sanjeeta Bhattacharya on Shah Rukh Khan's fatherly side on Jawan sets Directed by Atlee, Jawan stars Shah Rukh Khan in the lead role alongside Vijay Sethupathi and Nayanthara . Jawan is ruling the box office numbers. How you see the success? Lehar Khan: I'm not trying to brag about it but it was expected. (laughs) Is it because of the moral lesson hidden in the film? Lehar Khan: One of the reasons (behind success) was Shah Rukh Khan itself, of course. But, everything in the film leaves you curious; you want to find out what happens next. It's been surreal for me. Even before the release, I was like ‘Is this really happening?’ Also read: Jawan worldwide box office: Shah Rukh Khan film collects ? 531 crore Go on and tell us how has the Jawan shoot experience been… Lehar Khan: Everyone was warm on sets. Everyone was passionate about what they were making. They were in this together. Going on sets, being a fan of Shah Rukh sir, was itself a very surprising and overwhelming moment. I have grown up watching his films and dancing to his songs. My dream was to meet him someday, but it turned into something much more as his co-actor. I got to meet him, spend time with him and even dance. This was beyond my imagination and a dream come true, Atlee sir made it happen. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Lehar Khan (@leharkhan) What about Nayanthara and Vijay Sethupathi? Your Jawan girls are also making quite a buzz… Lehar Khan: Vijay sir and Nayanthara mam were very sweet and shy personalities. Vijay sir had a particular process on sets, I was intrigued by that. When he was on set, there are a lot of things he would come up with and pitch it to Atlee. That is something I have learned from him. Nayanthara mam has a strong aura; very captivating. I love my girl gang so much. We, six of us, have an unbreakable bond. There’s so much love; this is not going anywhere. This is friendship for life. I should mention Mukesh Chabbra sir who has brought us together. What about your interaction with Shah Rukh Khan? Lehar Khan: I remember him asking ‘Which school you were in? When I said Manav Sthali, he told me that he used to play on the ground. He was from Rajendra Nagar and was like ‘It used to be my neighborhood. I used be there for a lot of sports camps and all.’ Suddenly there was a connection. We talked about several things. It was usually that all six of us used to be around him. He used to offer us whatever he would eat in between the shoot. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Lehar Khan (@leharkhan) How is Shah Rukh like with his food? Is he diet conscious? Lehar Khan: No, I haven’t seen much consciousness about his diet. He doesn’t eat too much. He would usually munch something a little bit like makhana. I have not seen him on an extreme diet. He quite chilled in that way. Tell me about your journey so far… How was it from being on a cable TV show to bagging big ticket films like Brahmastra and Jawan… Lehar Khan: My journey started in the opposite way. I started as a child artist but I didn’t know if I wanted to become an actor. In my case, acting chose me. I was into dancing and going ahead with that after Kids Kids Dhoom. From there I got a short film which I took at 11 just for the experience. From there My name was given for Jalpari. When Jalpari happened, I became a proper child actor. It was still an occasional job for me until Parched. Leena Yadav mam called for Parched, and that experience changed my understanding of acting. The whole process made me fall in love with acting. I had people like Radhika Apte,Tannishtha Chatterjee, Sayani Gupta who really pushed. Later when I told my parents that acting was what I wanted, they just wanted to shift to Mumbai. I completed my 11th and 12th in Mumbai and while doing that I ended up getting Brahmastra, which was a huge film of 2022. When Brahmastra happened, I was like ‘Am I ready for this?’ but it opened me up. I got to know how big productions work and made me comfortable. Working with Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt and Ayan Mukerji was something else. After this I got Dahan and now Jawan. I remember reading about a difficult time in your just started career when you wanted to quit. Do you want to talk about it? Lehar Khan: It was regardless of the experiences I had. During covid-19 I lost my father. Because of this there came a point in my life where I was really low. My father was the happiest seeing me wherever I was reaching as an actor. There came a point when I became that low but it was him who brought me out. It was just then that I decided that I’d never quit. I know wherever he is watching me from he is proud and happy that I am following my dream. I think it’s him who is pushing me when I am working.

When BTS leader RM revealed how fans helped him when he wanted to quit music industry: 'They're changing my life',"BTS member RM, whose real name is Kim Namjoon , clocked his 29th birthday on Tuesday. All the group members-- RM , Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook have always credited their fandom, BTS ARMY for their support throughout their journey over the years. RM, who is also the leader of the group, once opened up in an interview with Rolling Stone India about how BTS fans helped with when he felt 'he can’t go on in this industry'. (Also Read | RM says ‘every day is a test’ as he talks about stress and missing BTS, responds to ‘gaining weight’ comment ) RM aka Kim Namjoon was born on September 12, 1994. RM spoke about BTS ARMY Speaking with Rolling Stone India in 2017, RM said, ""When we go abroad and they shake our hands or in the letters when they’re saying, ‘Namjoon, you changed my life,’ or ‘Your song inspired me’… That was one of the biggest things that kept my energy for years."" He further explained that when 'he feels like he can’t go on in this industry, he thinks about ARMY'. “Their voices that say, ‘All your songs, all your lyrics changed me, changed my life and made me chase my dream again…’ I see that and I just cannot quit. I really appreciate that. They are changing my life by saying I changed their lives,"" RM had also added. RM's letter to fans on 29th birthday As he clocked his 29th birthday on Tuesday, RM penned a long note on Weverse. It read, as translated by X (formerly known as Twitter) user @BTStranslation_, ""Hello. It's the last birthday of my 20s. I don't know if it's because of the characteristics of the field I work in, but birthdays always get accompanied by a bit of bashfulness. I think of it as an ordinary day but.. since many people congratulate me sincerely, I feel quite happy and blessed. I often think of the thought that love is like a name being given to someone. Until Kim Namjoon becomes 'Kim Namjoon'. It is just a day amongst the plentiful 365 days but the fact that this day doesn't feel like just a passing day to the twenty-nine-year-old me, is because of you all."" RM talks about being honest through his music A part of the letter also read, ""On receiving the sincerities I always thought should I try receiving them once as a downpour, the me who considered pessimism and futility as cool, I realized that I am also a temperamentally optimistic person. Isn't this a miracle. These days I live with the thought of 'why not'. Explained by the love I'm getting from around me, I'm living while sharing optimism. And it is also encompassing in my next songs that will come out someday. Right. Merely, would I be able to be honest through a way more beautiful than music? It's truth I already know but sometimes it feels not enough with just that. That is why I wonder if I became BTS. To express in various ways. Be it a program, or an interview, or dancing, be it anything.. what a blessed life it is. And these always make me want to look with both my eyes and contemplate, wherever I am (in life)."" RM talks about his letter and coincidence He also added, ""It is said when coincidence coincides, it is an inevitability. It is also said that coincidence is destiny disguised as a coincidence. It seems that me giving this letter to you is the same. The feeling that no matter which version of me it'd have been, I would've been writing this letter to you in September 2023. My birthday letters are each a different love language of where I have reached at that present time. And because of you all, I'm living really well. I want to live well."" RM talks about love with fans RM concluded, ""I just wanted to let you all know that I love you with the latest version of me. I cannot hug each and every one of you but know that my feelings are more than (just) that. I won't ask you to love me no matter what my form is. However, I want to try and make an effort for as much as I've received. The last birthday of my 20s is also going by smoothly like this. No matter which sky you are under, please be healthy and happy for a long time. See you again after a while. For your birthday too, in advance or a little belatedly, happy birthday sincerely! Thank you. - Namjoon ."" Recently, RM opened up about working on his music. Speaking on Weverse, he said that he is ""planning to release another album"".

Logitech's new Reach webcam raises presentations to a higher level,"Logitech has created a new way for professionals to record and share their work by placing one of its best webcams on a flexible, articulating arm. It’s fittingly called the Logitech Reach , and according to the official announcement, it enables users to host “engaging, interactive” presentations. The arm can be moved up, down, forward, and back – all with a push of the button located at the hinge. It can also be pivoted a full 360 degrees side-to-side for unique angles. The bottom base comes in two configurations: your typical flat stand so it can be placed on top of a desk and a clamp in case there isn't a lot of room available. When you’re done, the Reach can be folded in half for easy storage. As cool as the articulating arm may be on the Logitech Reach, the star of the show is obviously the camera at the far end. We’ve seen it before as it’s actually the Logitech StreamCam, a webcam we liked so much it landed on TechRadar’s list of the best webcams for 2023 . It’s capable of streaming videos up to 1080p resolution at 60FPS as well as take photographs with the same quality. The StreamCam shoots content with an overhead area of 12 x 21.5 inches. But thanks to its 4.3x lossless zoom, you can get as close as 2.75 x 5 inches without losing any detail. The webcam itself has its own hinge allowing users to pivot it horizontally and vertically just by twisting the ring grip around the body. Other notable features such as Smart Auto-Focus foster ease of use by ensuring that objects stay crystal clear, and there's connectivity via USB cable. The launch date and price point for the Logitech Reach are currently unknown. Engadget claims it discovered a survey on the official product page stating the “price point for early adopters” is around $300 to $400.

A Logitech representative told TheVerge the company did consider selling just the mount at one point, but decided against it because apparently “respondents in its market research” wanted the complete package. There wasn't a whole lot of interest in the arm alone. We reached out to Logitech asking for more information on the device’s price and availability. This story will be updated at a later time.

"Quordle today - hints and answers for Tuesday, September 12 (game #596)","It's time for your daily dose of Quordle hints, plus the answers for both the main game and the Daily Sequence spin off. Quordle is the only one of the many Wordle clones that I'm still playing now, around 18 months after the daily-word-game craze hit the internet, and with good reason: it's good fun, but also difficult. What's more, its makers (now the online dictionary Merriam-Webster) are also keeping it fresh in the form of a new variant called the Daily Sequence, which sees you complete four puzzles consecutively, rather than concurrently. But Quordle is tough, so if you already find yourself searching for Wordle hints , you'll probably need some for this game too. I'm a Quordle and Wordle fanatic who's been playing since December 2021, so I can definitely help you solve Quordle today and improve your game for tomorrow. Read on for my Quordle hints to game #596 and the answers to the main game and Daily Sequence. SPOILER WARNING: Information about Quordle today is below, so don't read on if you don't want to know the answers. Marc is TechRadar’s UK Editor in Chief and has been playing Wordle and Quordle for more than a year. He's authored dozens of articles on the game for TechRadar and its sister site Tom's Guide, including a detailed analysis of the most common letters in every position. His Wordle streak recently reached the 500 mark and he'll be inconsolable if he loses it. Yes, he takes it all too seriously. • The number of different vowels in Quordle today is 5 *. * Note that by vowel we mean the five standard vowels (A, E, I, O, U), not Y (which is sometimes counted as a vowel too). • The total number of vowels across today's Quordle answers is 7 . • The number of Quordle answers containing a repeated letter today is 2 . • The total number of different letters used in Quordle today is 13 . • No. None of Q, Z, X or J appear among today's Quordle answers. • The number of today's Quordle answers starting with the same letter is 2 . If you just want to know the answers at this stage, simply scroll down. If you're not ready yet then here's one more clue to make things a lot easier: • C • G • C • T Right, the answers are below, so DO NOT SCROLL ANY FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM. The answers to today's Quordle, game #596, are… How did you do today? Send me an email and let me know. The answers to today's Quordle Daily Sequence, game #596, are… Where Wordle challenges you to guess a new five-letter word each day, Quordle presents you with four puzzles to solve. And rather than complete them in turn, you do so simultaneously. You get nine guesses, rather than the six for Wordle, but the rules are otherwise very similar. It's played online via the Quordle website and you can also get to it via the Merriam-Webster site , after the dictionary purchased Quordle last year . As with Wordle, the answers are the same for every player each day, meaning that you're competing against the rest of the world. And also as with Wordle, the puzzle resets at midnight so you have a fresh challenge each day. The website also includes a practice mode - which I definitely recommend using before attempting the game proper! - and there are daily stats including a streak count. You also get Quordle Achievements - specific badges for winning a game in a certain number of turns, playing lots of times, or guessing particularly hard words. Oh, and it's difficult. Really difficult. The rules of Quordle are almost identical to those of Wordle. 1. Letters that are in the answer and in the right place turn green. 2. Letters that are in the answer but in the wrong place turn yellow. 3. Letters that are not in the answer turn gray… 4. …BUT the word you guess appears in all quadrants of the puzzle at the same time, so an A could turn green in one square, yellow in another and gray in the final two. 5. Answers are never plural. 6. Letters can appear more than once. So if your guess includes two of one letter, they may both turn yellow, both turn green, or one could be yellow and the other green. 7. Each guess must be a valid word in Quordle's dictionary. You can't guess ABCDE, for instance. 8. You do not have to include correct letters in subsequent guesses and there is no equivalent of Wordle's Hard mode. 9. You have nine guesses to find the Quordle answers. 10. You must complete the daily Quordle before midnight in your timezone. Quordle needs to be approached in a different way to Wordle. With four puzzles to solve in nine guesses, you can't blindly throw letters at it and expect to win - you'll stand a far better chance if you think strategically. That's the case in Wordle too, of course, but it's even more important in Quordle. There are two key things to remember. 1. Use several starting words Firstly, you won't want just a single starting word, but almost certainly two or three starting words. The first of these should probably be one of the best Wordle starting words , because the same things that make them work well will apply here too. But after that, you should select another word or possibly two that use up lots more of the most common consonants and that include any remaining vowels. For instance, I currently use STARE > DOILY > PUNCH. Between them, these three words use 15 of the 26 letters in the alphabet including all five vowels, Y, and nine of the most common consonants (S, T, R, D, L, P, N, C and H). There are plenty of other options - you might want to get an M, B, F or G in there instead of the H, maybe - but something like that should do the trick. If all goes well, that will give you a good lead on what one or sometimes two of the answers might be. If not, well good luck! 2. Narrow things down Secondly, if you're faced with a word where the answer might easily be one of several options - for instance -ATCH, where it could be MATCH, BATCH, LATCH, CATCH, WATCH, HATCH or PATCH - you'll definitely want to guess a word that would narrow down those options. In Wordle, you can instead try several of those in succession and hope one is right, assuming you have enough guesses left. It's risky, but will sometimes work. Plus, it's the only option in Hard mode. But in Quordle, this will almost certainly result in a failure - you simply don't have enough guesses. In the scenario above, CLAMP would be a great guess, as it could point the way to four of the seven words in one go.",technology
North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un Arrives in Russia Before Expected Meeting With Vladimir Putin After US Warnings of Weapons Deal,"Seoul, September 12: Joined by his top military officials handling his nuclear-capable weapons and munitions factories, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un arrived in Russia on Tuesday, where he is expected to hold a rare meeting with President Vladimir Putin that has sparked Western concerns about a potential arms deal for Moscow's war in Ukraine. North Korea's official news agency said Kim boarded his personal train from the capital, Pyongyang, on Sunday afternoon, and that he was accompanied by unspecified members of the country's ruling party, government and military. Jeon Ha Gyu, spokesperson of South Korea's Defence Ministry, said in a briefing that the South's military assesses that Kim's train crossed into Russia sometime early Tuesday. He didn't elaborate how the military obtained the information. North Korean state media showed photographs of Kim walking past honour guards and crowds of civilians holding the national flag and flowers, and also of him waving from his green-and-yellow armoured train before it left the station. Kim's delegation likely includes his foreign minister, Choe Sun Hui, and his top military officials, including Korean People's Army Marshals Ri Pyong Chol and Pak Jong Chon. Kim Jong Un Hosts Chinese and Russian Guests at Parade Celebrating North Korea's 75th Anniversary Citing unidentified Russian regional officials, Japanese broadcaster TBS reported that Kim's train crossed the border and arrived in the border town of Khasan. A brief statement on the Kremlin's website on Monday said the visit is at Putin's invitation and would take place “in the coming days.” KCNA said the leaders would meet — without specifying when and where. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Putin and Kim will lead their delegations in talks and could also meet “one-on-one if necessary.” He added that Putin will host an official dinner for Kim. The talks will focus on bilateral ties, Peskov said. “As with any of our neighbors, we feel obliged to develop good, mutually beneficial relations,” he added. A possible venue is the eastern Russian city of Vladivostok, where Putin arrived Monday to attend an international forum that runs through Wednesday, according to Russia's TASS news agency. The city, located about 425 miles (680 kilometers) north of Pyongyang, was also the site of Putin's first meeting with Kim in 2019. Vladimir Putin Is Dead? Ukraine Defence Intelligence Chief Kyrylo Budanov Claims Russian President Died Year Ago and Was Replaced With Body Double The visit would be Kim's first foreign trip since the COVID-19 pandemic, which had forced North Korea to enforce tight border controls for more than three years to shield its poor health care system. While Kim has shown to be more comfortable using planes than his famously flight-adverse father, he has also used his personal train for previous meetings with Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and former US President Donald Trump, reviving a symbol of his family's dynastic rule. Associated Press journalists near the North Korea-Russia frontier saw a green train with yellow trim — similar to one used by the reclusive Kim during previous foreign trips — at a station on the North Korean side of a border river. The train was seen moving back and forth between the station and the approach to the bridge that connects the countries, but it had not crossed the bridge as of 7 pm local time (1000 GMT). Citing unidentified South Korean government sources, the Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported that a Kim-Putin meeting is possible as early as Tuesday. The Yonhap news agency and some other media published similar reports. South Korea's Presidential Office, Defense Ministry and National Intelligence Service didn't immediately confirm those details. US officials released intelligence last week that North Korea and Russia were arranging a meeting between their leaders as they expand their cooperation in the face of deepening confrontations with the United States. According to US officials, Putin could focus on securing more supplies of North Korean artillery and other ammunition to refill declining reserves as he seeks to defuse a Ukrainian counteroffensive and show that he's capable of grinding out a long war of attrition. That could potentially put more pressure on the US and its partners to pursue negotiations as concerns over a protracted conflict grow despite their huge shipments of advanced weaponry to Ukraine in the past 17 months. “Arms discussions between Russia and the DPRK are expected to continue during Kim Jong Un's trip to Russia,” said White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson, using the abbreviation for North Korea's official name of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. “We urge the DPRK to abide by the public commitments that Pyongyang has made to not provide or sell arms to Russia.” State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Washington will monitor the meeting closely, reminding both countries that “any transfer of arms from North Korea to Russia would be a violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions”, and that the US “will not hesitate to impose new sanctions”. North Korea has possibly tens of millions of artillery shells and rockets based on Soviet designs that could potentially give a huge boost to the Russian army, analysts say. In exchange, Kim could seek badly needed energy and food aid and advanced weapons technologies, including those related to intercontinental ballistic missiles, nuclear-capable ballistic missile submarines and military reconnaissance satellites, analysts say. There are concerns that potential Russian technology transfers would increase the threat posed by Kim's growing arsenal of nuclear weapons and missiles that are designed to target the US, South Korea, and Japan. Based on North Korean state media photos, Kim's delegation possibly includes Pak Thae Song, chairman of North Korea's space science and technology committee, and Navy Admiral Kim Myong Sik, who are linked with North Korean efforts to acquire spy satellites and nuclear-capable submarines. Kim Jong Un also seems to be bringing Jo Chun Ryong, a ruling party official in charge of munitions policies who had accompanied the leader on his recent tours to factories producing artilleries and missiles. After decades of a complicated, hot-and-cold relationship, Russia and North Korea have been drawing closer since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The bond has been driven by Putin's need for war help and Kim's efforts to boost the visibility of his partnerships with traditional allies Moscow and Beijing as he tries to break out of diplomatic isolation and have North Korea be part of a united front against Washington. While using the distraction caused by the Ukraine conflict to ramp up its weapons development, North Korea has repeatedly blamed Washington for the crisis in Ukraine, claiming the West's “hegemonic policy” justified a Russian offensive in Ukraine to protect itself. North Korea is the only nation besides Russia and Syria to recognise the independence of two Russian-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine — Donetsk and Luhansk -– and it has also hinted at an interest in sending construction workers to those areas to help with rebuilding efforts. Russia -– along with China -– have blocked US-led efforts at the UN Security Council to strengthen sanctions on North Korea over its intensifying missile tests while accusing Washington of worsening tensions with Pyongyang by expanding military exercises with South Korea and Japan. The United States has been accusing North Korea since last year of providing Russia with arms, including artillery shells sold to the Russian mercenary group Wagner. Both Russian and North Korean officials denied such claims. But speculation about the countries' military cooperation grew after Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu made a rare visit to North Korea in July, when Kim invited him to an arms exhibition and a massive military parade in the capital where he showcased ICBMs designed to target the US mainland. Following that visit, Kim toured North Korea's weapons factories, including a facility producing artillery systems where he urged workers to speed up the development and large-scale production of new kinds of ammunition. Experts say Kim's visits to the factories likely had a dual goal of encouraging the modernization of North Korean weaponry and examining artillery and other supplies that could possibly be exported to Russia. Some analysts say a potential meeting between Kim and Putin would be more about symbolic gains than substantial military cooperation. Russia, which has always closely guarded its most important weapons technologies, even from key allies such as China, could be unwilling to make major technology transfers with North Korea for what is likely to be limited war supplies transported over a small rail link between the countries, they say.

Is Elon Musk in ‘Demon Mode’? New biography digs deeper into the life of the world’s richest man,"is unveiled as a complex character in an eagerly-awaited biography by Walter Isaacson, the man renowned for chronicling the lives of Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein and Leonardo da Vinci. Driven by what some describe as a ""demonic"" zeal, Musk's multifaceted life—from his early struggles with an overbearing father to his recent unorthodox management decisions—gets a closer look. Isaacson's book on Musk has already become a bestseller in the United States, even before its official release. Despite being over 600 pages long, it has caught the attention of both media and readers alike, with advance orders topping Amazon’s US charts. Also Read: Musk's life journey has always intrigued many. In this biography, much light is shed on Musk's complex relationship with his father, Errol, who is portrayed as a manipulative individual. According to the author, it's this early life turmoil that's become the driving force behind Musk's extreme productivity and unparalleled ambition. The book borrows a term from Musk's former partner, Grimes, dubbing this driving force as ""demon mode""—a state claimed to be common among high achievers. While many aspects of Musk's early life are already in the public domain, Isaacson's work offers new insights into Musk’s more recent ventures. The book describes an incident where Musk’s decision to deny Starlink Internet access to the Ukrainian military led to tensions with Kyiv. However, the validity of this account was later questioned by Musk himself, AFP reported. Also Read: The acquisition of Twitter, now rebranded as X, by Musk also finds significant coverage in Isaacson's narrative. Shortly after the takeover, Musk and his team sifted through internal communications, leading to the sacking of numerous employees who had expressed reservations about the new management. Interestingly, Musk’s conviction that technology and willpower alone can bring about monumental change is also touched upon. His refusal to collaborate with Bill Gates on charitable initiatives, simply because Gates had bet against Tesla in the stock market, offers another glimpse into his strong-willed nature. Also Read: Moreover, the biography reveals that Musk, concerned about global depopulation, has fathered 10 children, including a previously undisclosed child with Grimes and twins via sperm donation to Shivon Zilis, an executive at Neuralink, a company owned by Musk. While some critics have lauded Isaacson's deep reporting, others believe the book falls short in offering a nuanced interpretation of Musk. (With AFP inputs)",business

India Vs Sri Lanka Asia Cup 2023 Super 4 Match No 10 Live Streaming For Free: When And Where To Watch IND Vs SL Super 4 Match LIVE In India Online And On TV,"Team India will be on the field for the third successive day as they take on Sri Lanka in the fourth Super 4 match of the Asia Cup 2023 at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Tuesday. With rain interrupting India’s first Super 4 match against arch-rivals Pakistan, the game ended on the ‘Reserve Day’ on Monday and means Rohit Sharma’s side will not get any break ahead of their match against Sri Lanka. Dasun Shanaka-led Sri Lanka are on a 13-match winning streak in ODI cricket this year – the second-best in the history of the game after Australia’s 21-game winning streak.

"""When I Retire..."": Kuldeep Yadav Sums Up His Performance Against Pakistan","India spinner Kuldeep Yadav on Monday said his match-winning five-wicket haul against Pakistan in the Asia Cup will remain a spell to ""remember"" even after retirement. Kuldeep, a left-arm wrist spinner, returned figures of 5-25 to help bowl out Pakistan for 128 while chasing 357 for victory in the rain-hit Super Four clash in Colombo. The 50-over contest carried over into a reserve day set aside by the tournament, which remains a tune-up to the upcoming ODI World Cup in India. ""I am feeling very happy,"" Kuldeep told reporters. ""To take five wickets against a good team will always be remembered. When I stop cricket and retire, I will always remember that I took five wickets against Pakistan."" He further added, ""Because a side that plays spin well in the sub-continent, to play well against them really motivates you."" Kuldeep, 28, overcame a threatening knee injury to return to the international game last year and since performed well in the Indian Premier League and for the national team. The bowler has made his way back as a regular in the Indian XI and remains a key bowler for the team in the World Cup starting October. ""One-and-a-half years has been amazing. Bowling really well and not thinking too much about the playing XI and all,"" said Kuldeep. ""Just enjoying my bowling. Every morning when I wake and think that whenever I get the opportunity I stay fit to deliver. All through IPL I have been working hard on my length that matters a lot for any spinner.

"""Beyond People's Imagination"": Rajeev Shukla On India's Win vs Pakistan","After India clinched their biggest victory over Pakistan in ODIs in a match of the Super Four stage of the Aisa Cup, BCCI Vice President Rajeev Shukla praised Team India and said that the win was ""beyond people's imagination"". Fiery centuries from Virat Kohli and KL Rahul followed by Kuldeep Yadav's five-wicket haul powered India to 228 runs win over their traditional rival Pakistan at R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Monday. ""Today Virat Kohli and KL Rahul did wonders, 356 runs on 2 wickets... India made a huge score... It was beyond people's imagination, the way they demonstrated,"" Rajeev Shukla told ANI on Monday. He also spoke about Virat's achievement of breaking the record of Sachin Tendulkar by completing the fastest 13,000 runs in international cricket. ""Virat Kohli also completed his 13,000 runs in international cricket, he broke the record of Sachin Tendulkar, and this is a huge achievement. This is a big victory for us, so many congratulations to the Indian team,"" Rajeev Shukla added. While Sachin Tendulkar needed 321 innings to reach the milestone, Kohli did so in 267 innings. The only other three batters to reach the mark, Ricky Ponting, Mahela Jayawardene, and Sanath Jayasuriya, also required more than 300 innings. In the match, Virat scored a brilliant 122 off 94 while KL Rahul, who was making his comeback after a long break, smashed a dashing 111 off 106. Kuldeep bagged his second ODI five-for as India clinched a huge 228-run win - Naseem Shah and Haris Rauf didn't come out to bat in Pakistan's chase. With this mammoth victory, India clinched the top spot in of Asia Cup 2023 Super 4s table. Earlier, Virat Kohli and KL Rahul's century powered India to 356/2 against arch-rivals Pakistan in their Asia Cup Super Four clash. Captain Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill's half-centuries laid the foundation for India, while the unbeaten 233-run partnership between Kohli and Rahul added the icing on the cake as the former skipper finished the innings in style with a maximum. Kohli finished his innings with an unbeaten 122, which came from 94 deliveries, while Rahul smashed 111 of 106 balls.

"Straighter run-up, aggressive rhythm key to my ODI success: Kuldeep Yadav","PTI Colombo, September 12 Left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav believes tweaks in his technique, including a straighter run-up and an aggressive rhythm, has helped him to improve his bowling and achieve success in ODI cricket. The 28-year-old has taken 27 wickets from 14 matches this year, the highest by an Indian bowler in ODIs. ""After the (knee) surgery (last year), my run-up has become much straighter, and rhythm has become aggressive. My hand used to fall over but that has been controlled and now it (hand) is facing the batsman,” said Kuldeep in the post-match press conference. Kuldeep said he had worked on spin and drift post his surgery to improve his efficiency. ""I exerted care not to lose my spin and drift without losing my pace. If a leg-spinner lands the ball on a good length, he can pick up wickets more regularly and loose balls can be reduced. You can be consistent,"" he added. Kuldeep said he worked with NCA physio Ashish Koushik post his surgery to reduce the burden on his knee while landing in the crease. ""I did not want to lose my zip, nip or drift. After surgery I went for a three-month recuperation at NCA and physio Ashish Koushik said I had to reduce the load on my knee. So, I worked to make my rhythm faster,"" he said. However, Kuldeep said it took him some time to make the remodelled action work at the top level cricket. ""I tried the new action in a practice game in Kanpur. The batsmen were struggling to face me. But even in the IPL and during the tour of the West Indies I was struggling with it (action). ""It took some 6-7 matches for me to make work at this level,"" said Kuldeep. 'Performing against a top opposition like Pakistan motivates me' His (5/25) five-wicket haul helped India outclass Pakistan by a massive 228-run margin and Kuldeep said he will always remember this effort as it came against a top opposition. ""I will always remember that I picked up five wickets against Pakistan when I retire. It is a big thing for me because Pakistan players can play spin well. If you perform against a side that plays spin well in the subcontinent, it motivates you,"" said he said. #Cricket",sports
"Libya Floods: 2,000 Feared Dead in Derna Deluge, Thousands Missing","The Mediterranean storm Daniel led to devastating floods in Libya breaking dams and washing away entire neighbourhoods in the coastal areas of the east African nation. A report by the Associated Press said that as many as 2,000 people were feared dead, one leader of the country said. Derna emerged as the worst affected city in Libya. The city, already struggling to emerge from the clutches of years of unrest and terrorism has now become inaccessible due to the floods. The government released data puts the death toll from the weekend flooding at 61. This tally did not include Derna. The Associated Press says that two dams burst in Derna and as many as thousands were carried away along with the floodwaters. Videos making rounds on the internet shed light on the magnitude of the devastation and entire residential areas were erased along a river that runs down from the mountains through the city centre. The multistory apartment buildings that once stood well back from the river were pictured collapsed into the mud. Prime Minister Ossama Hamad of the government in east Libya said 2,000 were feared dead in Derna and thousands were believed missing. He said Derna is now a disaster zone. The prime minister also announced three days of mourning and ordered flags across the country to be lowered to half-staff. Ahmed al-Mosmari, a spokesman for the country’s armed forces, said the death toll in Derna has crossed 2,000 and around 5,000-6,000 of the city’s residents are missing. Derna infrastructure is in a dilapidated state as extremism gripped the resource-rich eastern African for decades following the ouster of the Moammar Gadhafi government. The nation remains divided between two rival administrations, one in the east and one in the west, each backed by militias and foreign governments while cities like Derna are left with crumbling and inadequate infrastructure. The lack of a centralised government will further exacerbate the problems of those affected by the floods. This means that aid as well as restructuring and repairing the infrastructure and the nation’s roads and public services will be a tough objective for authorities to accomplish in the wake of the devastation. In Bayda, at least 46 people were reported dead while seven others died in the coastal town of Susa and seven others were reported dead in the towns of Shahatt and Omar al-Mokhtar, according to local authorities and Ossama Abduljaleel, health minister. One died in the town of Marj. The local media reported that the situation in Derna is catastrophic with no power or communication. Foreign governments, like the UAE and Egypt, sent messages of support. The UAE’s Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan said Abu Dhabi will send humanitarian assistance and search-and-rescue teams to eastern Libya. Algeria, Turkey and Iraq also sent condolences and assured support. Georgette Gagnon, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Libya and the US Embassy in Libya called on local, national and international partners to come together and determine how to deliver aid to the worst impacted areas.",world
Drew Barrymore criticized for returning with talk show amid Hollywood strikes,"Drew Barrymore has been criticized by fellow writers and actors for returning with the fourth season of her talk show amid the ongoing dual strikes in Hollywood. She has also been slammed for endorsing ‘scabbing’, a derogatory term used for someone who refuses to join a union, thus remaining free to work during a strike. Recently, in an Instagram post, Barrymore announced that her popular chat show The Drew Barrymore Show’ will begin airing its fourth season soon (from September 18.) The show, she maintained, is in compliance with the conditions of the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strikes. A spokesperson for CBS had earlier told Variety that the show will not be performing “any writing work covered by the WGA strike.” However, The Writers Guild of America, East, had earlier issued a statement saying that The Drew Barrymore Show is a struck show, and union members are planning to picket it this week. Responding to the WGA statement, TV writer Gennefer Gross wrote, “Drew Barrymore has always been someone who recognized her privilege and aimed to evolve, so I hope she will reconsider this hasty decision intended to pay her crew because it weakens both unions to openly endorse scabbing.” TV actor and writer Felicia Day wrote, “Sooo who is writing her opening monologue and literally everything else on this show when it starts up again next week?

Millie Bobby Brown turns author with romance novel ‘Nineteen Steps’,"The actor who plays Eleven on “Stranger Things” wrote a romance novel! That’ll be the headline for too much coverage of “Nineteen Steps,” so let’s set that aside and consider the debut book from Millie Bobby Brown on its own merits. It’s a love story set in London, spanning the wartime years of 1942-1945. Nellie is the protagonist, an 18-year-old young woman who works as a secretary for the mayor of Bethnal Green, in the city’s East End. She lives with her mother, father, brother and little sister, and next door to her best friend Babs, whose brother, Billy, is besotted with Nellie after a childhood spent together. In the wake of the Blitz, Germany continues to selectively bomb England, forcing Nellie and the rest of Bethnal Green’s citizens into an underground air raid shelter many nights. That’s where those foreboding titular steps come in: Every time they descend to the shelter, Nellie “counted them like usual. Nineteen, turn right and seven more.” Spoiler fans can stop at this point and Google the “Bethnal Green steps,” but what’s the fun in that? Brown dedicates the book to her grandmother (“Nanny Ruth, who told me this story”), but the book is being marketed as fiction, with all the usual disclaimers about how any “references to real people, events, etc…. are intended only to provide a sense of authenticity, and are used fictitiously.” The story starts to sing when Nellie meets Ray, a U.S. Air Force pilot stationed nearby. The prose describing their first kiss fits the moon-eyed mood as the young couple falls hopelessly in love. “If ever she had to pick a moment she’d want to last for eternity, she thought, this would be the one she’d choose,” writes Brown. Honestly, most readers could predict the rest of the plot at this point. The love triangle involving Nellie, Billy and Ray, plays a central role, and, of course, what happens on those steps, but the book is really about making your way when consumed by grief. And in that aspect it succeeds, painting a brave portrait of Nellie and her family and friends as they struggle to survive and find happiness in a world gone mad. Time will tell if Brown has more stories in her, but her late, beloved grandmother would assuredly be proud of this first effort.",entertainment

'Dumb Money' goes all in on the GameStop stock frenzy — and may come out a winner,"Think of movies about the financial system and your mind is almost sure to go to Gordon Gekko and “Wall Street” or Leonardo DiCaprio’s gyrating Jordan Belfort in “The Wolf of Wall Street.” When Hollywood takes on Wall Street, it usually heads straight to the C-suite. The protagonist of “Dumb Money,” though, is an amateur investor who trades out of his basement in Brockton, Massachusetts, with a bandana tied around his head and a Belgian beer in his hand. This is Keith Gill (played in the film by Paul Dano), also known as Roaring Kitty. In 2021, Gill’s enthusiastic endorsement of GameStop stock helped fuel a viral trading frenzy that rocked Wall Street and humbled the hedge funds that has shorted the brick-and-mortar video game company. Now, Sony Pictures is betting that a David vs. Goliath story that played out on Reddit message boards can be a big-screen attraction, too. Like any investment, it carries some degree of risk. “Dumb Money,” made for about $30 million, is charging into a still-fresh wound for some Wall Street power players; at least one executive portrayed in the film has reportedly threatened to sue. The film, which opens in limited release Friday and expands in the next several weeks, will also have to sell itself without its colorful ensemble cast (including Pete Davidson, Seth Rogen, America Ferrara, Anthony Ramos and Shailene Woodley) due to the actors strike. And then there’s the inherent challenge of making a dramatic narrative out of a revolution that occurred mainly on computer screens and smartphones. Yet Craig Gillespie, director of the Tonya Harding black comedy “I, Tonya,” managed to corral a brash online movement into a remarkably rollicking and crowd-pleasing entertainment that's already stoking some of the same energy that sent GameStop soaring. Ticket prices to the movie’s Toronto International Film Festival were driven past $900 on secondary seller websites. “As much as it’s a really fun ride, ultimately I wanted to respect the frustration and the outrage that was happening,” says Gillespie. There are many ironies surrounding “Dumb Money.” It will play in AMC Theaters, which followed GameStop as a meme stock, pumping up its share price at a time when movie theaters were reeling from the pandemic. “I think we should go to AMC Theaters and we should bring stuff from Bed Bath and Beyond and carry Blackberries,” says Ben Mezrich, author of the book the film’s adapted from, “The Antisocial Network: The GameStop Short Squeeze and the Ragtag Group of Amateur Traders That Brought Wall Street to Its Knees.” Mezrich, whose 2009 book about Mark Zuckerberg, “The Accidental Billionaire,” served as fodder for David Fincher’s “The Social Network,” immediately recognized the potential drama in the GameStop phenomenon. On the day the company's stock surpassed $300 a share, he began plotting a book that could adapted into a movie. “By the end of that day, I knew that this was something that I wanted to write and I could see it as a film,” says Mezrich. “That night, I wrote a 12-page proposal and treatment as both a movie and book idea. By the end of the week, we had a movie.” “Dumb Money” proceeded at a ripped-from-the-headlines pace — fast enough that most of those involved making it failed to invest, themselves. Gillespie was able to follow the phenomenon thanks to his 24-year-old son, who had been involved with the subreddit Wall Street Bets. “I got to live it through him,” says Gillespie. “That was a huge touchstone for me in terms of the emotionality of the film. That frustration, that outrage, all those emotions that were happening through this. I actually got in too late, myself. My son warned me: You got in too late.” Lauren Schuker Blum and Rebecca Angelo, two former Wall Street Journal reporters turned screenwriters, came on to write the script. For them it was a way to extend their interest in the power of internet populism — and they already had some experience turning digital-based stories into something human. “We wrote a film about GamerGate a long time ago that didn’t get made,” says Blum. “The producer in that process was like, ‘Alright, let’s just go out and invent a new language of cinema.’ It has taken many years trying to figure out: How do you make a story like this cinematic?” “Dumb Money” seamlessly juggles a wide spectrum of characters who invest in GameStop for various reasons — a Pittsburgh single-mother nurse (Ferrera), a GameStop employee (Ramos), a pair of in-debt college students (Myha’la Herrold and Talia Ryder) — while breezily synthesizing the complicated economic context. “We don’t need Margot Robbie in a bathtub explaining complex financial concepts,” says Angelo, referencing 2015's “The Big Short.” The meme-stuffed grammar of the film owes much to the frenetic, inundating experience of social media, but it also works as a surprisingly accurate portrait of the pandemic. You may be surprised how affectingly, and empoweringly, the film uses the then-ubiquitous TikToks of Megan Thee Stallion’s “Savage.” “It was a time when people were feeling very small. They feel small, they feel powerless, they feel that the system is rigged,” says Angelo. “And this was an opportunity to feel big and find power in numbers.” Gill, himself, dropped out of the spotlight as fast he entered it. His last tweet from his “Roaring Kitty” account was posted in 2021, of sleeping kittens. His investments, originally about $50,000 (much of his young family’s savings) when GameStop was going for about $5 a share, at one point reached $48 million in value. The filmmakers attempted to reach Gill but ultimately respected his privacy and had no direct contact with him. Gill has said little publicly since testifying before Congress in 2021.

"Smoking Accelerates Aging Process, Quitting Can Make You Stay Young and Healthy For Long: Study","Beijing, September 12: If you want to stay young and healthy for long, then quit smoking as it might not only harm your lungs and overall health, but can also make you age faster, according to a study of nearly 500,000 people. The study, presented at the European Respiratory Society International Congress in Milan, Italy, showed that smoking shortens the end fragments of chromosomes in the white blood cells of our immune systems. The length of these end fragments, called telomeres, is an indicator of how quickly we age and our cells’ ability to repair and regenerate. “Our study shows that smoking status and cigarette quantity can result in the shortening of leukocyte telomere length, which is an indicator of tissue self-repair, regeneration and ageing. In other words, smoking can accelerate the process of ageing, while quitting may considerably decrease the related risk,” said Siyu Dai, Assistant Professor in the School of Clinical Medicine at Hangzhou Normal University in China. Telomeres are lengths of repetitive DNA sequences that protect the ends of chromosomes. European Space Agency Says Its JUICE Mission Is Ready To Study Jupiter and Its Icy Moons. Each time a cell divides, the telomeres become slightly shorter, eventually becoming so short that the cell can no longer divide successfully, and it dies. This is part of the ageing process. Telomere length in white blood cells (called leukocytes) has been linked previously to smoking, but, until now, there has been little research into whether smoking status and the quantity of cigarettes smoked actually caused the shortening in telomere length. The researchers used genomic data from 472,174 UK Biobank participants, related to current smokers, those who never smoked, and for people who had smoked previously. AI Can Crack Password! New Study Reveals Artificial Intelligence Can Guess Commonly-Used Passwords in Less Than a Minute; Know Steps To Protect Your Devices and Data. They found that current smoking status was statistically significantly associated with shorter leukocyte telomere length, whereas previous smokers and people who had never smoked didn’t show significantly shorter leukocyte telomere length. Among people who used to smoke, there was a trend towards shorter telomere length, but this was not statistically significant. People who smoked the greater number of cigarettes had significantly shorter leukocyte telomere length. “In summary, smoking may cause the shortening of leukocyte telomere length, and the more cigarettes smoked, the stronger the shortening effect,” said Dai. In recent years, observational studies have linked shortened leukocyte telomere length with many diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and muscle loss. This means that the effect of smoking on telomere length probably plays a critical role in these diseases, although more research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms. “Our study adds to the evidence that smoking causes ageing. As there are clear health benefits of smoking cessation, it is time to include cessation support as well as treatment into daily clinical management to help us to create a smoke-free environment for the next generation,” Dai added.

"Watch: Man Shares Hack For Buying Fruits, Internet Dissaproves","Buying fruits is an everyday task, whether it's from bustling supermarkets or humble roadside stalls. But, here is the twist - sometimes those fruits that look picture-perfect on the outside turn out to be disappointing once you slice into them. So, what is the secret to avoiding this fruit regret? Well, an Instagram reel is here to rescue all those who struggle with fruit selection. These simple tips claim to offer easy ways to decipher a fruit's quality by simply inspecting its outer appearance. But guess what? The internet does not seem to be extremely convinced as the comment section of this video is full of critical comments. The video begins with a man sharing thoughts on selecting the right avocados . He demonstrates this by removing the stem from the first avocado, revealing a yellow inner surface, indicating its unripeness. The second avocado exposes a dark brown inner surface, signaling its spoilage. Finally, the third avocado's green inner part proves it to be perfectly ripe and ready to eat. Moving on to melons, the process is straightforward. Checking the stem is the key: if it's green, the melon isn't ripe, but if it's dry, it's good to go. When it comes to pineapples , the selection is as simple as assessing the colour. Green pineapples are a no-go, while orange ones are perfectly ripe. Lastly, for watermelons , the man recommends looking for those with orange spots, larger webbing, and dry stems. Also Read: Daughter Forgets To Order Fruits, Father's Reaction Goes Viral Take a look at the video below: A post shared by This is Hack (@this_is_hack_1) The caption of the video reads, “How to choose different fruit?” The video became a hit on Instagram with 5.2 million views. Hundreds of people in the comments were criticising the man's technique and some were even sharing their own hacks . A user wrote, “It will make the avocado that you have checked become worse.” Another one added, “You really do it every time you buy it? Maybe the next person won't like to find the avocado touched.” Someone joked, “Just imagine someone comes to the avocado store after you and realised that all avocados are checked.” A person gave a new tip by writing, “If you just shake the avocado and hear the seed is loose, it's ready to eat... no need for this method.” Do you have any other fruit-checking tips?

7 Post-Meal Mistakes That Make You Gain Weight. Stop Now!,"What do you do after a hearty meal? While we all put in a lot of thought about what goes into our stomachs, what we don't realise is that our wrong post-meal habits are too much for our stomachs to handle. Even if you are eating a healthy meal, your post-meal routine can still affect your health adversely. Your digestive system plays a crucial role in your overall health and the way you treat it after eating matters. If you wonder why your health is not top-notch and why you are not able to lose weight despite eating healthy, you could be making the following mistakes. Also Read: What To Do After Eating Oily Food - 10 Ways To Recover From The Effects Exercising right after a meal is not a good idea. Nutritionist Anju Sood explains, ""Your body expends a lot of energy during digestion, and intense physical activity can divert blood away from your stomach, hindering the digestion process."" It's essential to give your body time to digest the food before engaging in strenuous workouts. A leisurely walk is a better option to aid digestion without overexerting yourself. We are giving you another to kick the butt. Smoking immediately after a meal is detrimental to your health. ""Nicotine in cigarettes binds with oxygen in your blood and gets absorbed more quickly during digestion. This not only affects your lung health but also disrupts the natural digestive process,"" Nutritionist Anju Sood. If you're looking for another reason to kick the smoking habit, this is it. It's natural to crave a cup of soothing tea right after a meal. Tea, especially black tea, contains tannins, which interfere with the body's iron absorption capacity. This can lead to reduced nutrient absorption from your meal, particularly if it's rich in iron. To avoid this interference, it's advisable to wait at least 30 minutes after your meal before sipping on your favourite brew. A relaxing bath can be tempting after a satisfying meal, but it might not be the best thing to do. When you take a bath, the blood around your stomach tends to flow to other parts of your body, slowing down the digestion process. It's better to bathe before and much later after you have digested your food properly. It's natural to feel sleepy after a hefty meal, especially in the afternoons. You should know that when you sleep, your body continues working hard to process the food you've consumed. This can lead to indigestion and potentially contribute to weight gain over time. Fruits are undeniably healthy, but they require different enzymes to digest compared to other foods. If you consume fruits immediately after a meal, their fibres may not digest properly. To ensure efficient digestion and maximise the nutritional benefits of fruits, consider eating them as a separate snack between meals or at least 30 minutes before your main meal. Last but not least, avoid feeling guilty about your meal choices. Beating yourself over what you've eaten can lead to a cycle of deprivation and binge eating, which is unhealthy for both your physical and mental well-being. Instead, focus on making balanced food choices and practising moderation. Also Read : Feeling Bloated After Every Meal? 5 Effective Remedies To Try Now that we've discussed what to avoid after eating, let's explore some positive actions you can take to support digestion and overall well-being. Nutritionist Simrat Kathuria, in an Instagram post on her handle, shared some post-meal dos one should follow. A post shared by Simrat Kathuria Diet Xperts (@simratkathuria) Don't be too hard on yourself about your indulgent meals. Excessive guilt can lead to unhealthy eating patterns. Instead, practice mindfulness and moderation. A gentle stroll after 30 minutes of having your meal can stimulate digestion and help regulate blood sugar levels. It's a simple and effective way to aid your body in processing the food you've consumed. Carbonated beverages can fill up your digestive system with gas, leading to bloating. Opt for plain water or herbal tea instead to stay hydrated. Avoid lying down or taking naps immediately after eating, as this can slow down digestion and worsen acid reflux. Engage in light activities or sit upright to support the digestive process. Go ahead and enjoy a delicious meal, but be mindful of what you do afterwards to ensure you live a healthy life.

One In Three Female Surgeons In UK Have Been Sexually Assaulted: Survey,"90% of women had witnessed some form of sexual misconduct, survey revealed. Female surgeons in the United Kingdom have been sexually assaulted, and in some cases raped by colleagues, in the past five years, a new survey has revealed. The study, published in the British Journal of Surgery (BJS) and shared with the BBC , examined sexual conduct in the UK surgical workforce over the past five years. It found that almost one in three female surgeons working in the NHS (National Health Service) have been sexually assaulted by colleagues. As per the survey , registered surgeons - men and women - were invited to take part completely anonymously and 1,434 responded. It found that 30% of female surgeons who responded said they had been sexually assaulted, 29% of women had experienced unwanted physical advances at work, over 40% had received uninvited comments about their body and 38% received sexual ""banter"" at work. ""90% of women, and 81% of men, had witnessed some form of sexual misconduct,"" the BBC reported citing the study. The survey concluded that men and women surgeons are ""living different realities"". ""Sexual misconduct occurs frequently and appears to go unchecked in the surgical environment owing to a combination of a deeply hierarchical structure and a gender and power imbalance. The result is an unsafe working environment and an unsafe space for patients,"" it added, as per The Guardian .

Rescuers Race Against Time To Find Survivors After Deadly Morocco Quake,"Hopes were dimming on Tuesday in Morocco's desperate search for survivors, four days after a powerful earthquake killed more than 2,800 people, most of them in remote villages in the High Atlas Mountains. Search-and-rescue teams from the kingdom and abroad kept digging through the rubble of broken mud-brick homes, hoping for signs of life in a race against time following the 6.8-magnitude quake late Friday. In the tourist hub of Marrakesh, whose UNESCO-listed historic centre suffered cracks and other major damage, many families still slept out in the open, huddled in blankets on public squares for fear of aftershocks. But the need was most desperate in remote and poor mountain villages such as Missirat, only reachable via winding dirt roads southwest of Marrakesh, where traumatised inhabitants have searched by hand for missing relatives. Many of the region's traditional adobe homes crumbled to rubble and dust, while some concrete houses now stand ajar, their former residents gingerly salvaging mattresses, blankets and cooking utensils from them. ""We feel completely abandoned here, no one has come to help us,"" one desperate villager, Khadija Aitlkyd, 43, told AFP. ""Our houses have collapsed and we have nowhere to go. Where are all these poor people going to live?"" Residents of the village of under 100 people said bodies of the 16 villagers killed in the quake have been recovered, but their dead livestock under the stones and timber was starting to decompose. Remote villages destroyed Rescuers, aid trucks and private volunteers kept travelling to stricken villages in the barren foothills of the High Atlas, many accessible only via dusty dirt roads affected by rockfalls. In the village of Asni, in the worst-hit province of Al Haouz, the army set up a field hospital with medical tents where more than 300 patients had been treated by Monday, Colonel Youssef Qamouss told AFP. ""The hospital was deployed 48 hours ago,"" he said, adding that it has an X-ray unit, pharmacy and other facilities. ""It started operating this morning and we're already at more or less 300 patients."" Many Moroccan citizens have rushed to help quake victims with food, water, blankets and other aid or by donating blood to help treat the injured, an effort joined by the national football team. The quake was Morocco's strongest on record and the deadliest to hit the North African country since a 1960 earthquake destroyed Agadir on the Atlantic coast, killing between 12,000 and 15,000 people. Overall, at least 2,862 people have died and more than 2,500 been injured in the latest tragedy, according to an official toll issued late Monday. Morocco has allowed rescue teams to come to its aid from Spain, Britain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates but so far declined offers from several other nations, including the United States and Israel. 100,000 children affected Albert Vasquez, the Spanish unit's communications officer, warned on Monday that ""it's very difficult to find people alive after three days"" but stressed that ""hope is still there"". The United Nations estimated that more than 300,000 people have been affected, one third of them children, by the powerful seismic event that hit just after 11 pm (2200 GMT) when most families were asleep. ""Thousands of homes have been destroyed, displacing families and exposing them to the elements at a time of year when temperatures drop down during the nighttime,"" the UN children's agency said. ""Schools, hospitals and other medical and educational facilities have been damaged or destroyed by the quakes, further impacting children.""

"""Breathed On Back Of My Neck"": Ex Australia Minister Harassed In Parliament","When she raised the behaviour with others she was asked: ""Can't you take a joke?"" Australia's former home affairs minister said Tuesday a male colleague used to breathe down her neck as she spoke in parliament, becoming the latest woman to question the country's political culture. Karen Andrews, now a senior conservative politician, said when she raised the unnamed man's behaviour with others she was asked: ""Can't you take a joke?"" The macho nature of Australian politics was highlighted in late 2021 when a scathing review found the country's halls of power rife with heavy drinking, bullying, and sexual harassment. Similar criticism flared again earlier this year, when two politicians from different sides of the aisle accused the same conservative senator of sexual assault. Andrews, who will retire at the next election, added her voice to the chorus of condemnation in an interview with Australian broadcaster ABC. ""I did have one of my male colleagues who used to breathe on the back of my neck in question time,"" Andrews said when asked if she had experienced harassment in parliament. ""I'd just be sitting there minding my own business and I would have the back of my neck breathed on. ""And if I asked a question, it would be: 'That was a great question, thrusting and probing'... that sort of stuff."" A broad review published in November 2021 found that one in three people working inside Australia's Parliament House had experienced some form of sexual harassment. The same review, by the Australian Human Rights Commission, also found a laddish culture permeated the building, fuelled by frequent bouts of heavy drinking.

An interactive platform that explains machine learning models to its users,"September 12, 2023 feature This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked peer-reviewed publication trusted source proofread by Ingrid Fadelli , Tech Xplore Machine learning models are now commonly used in various professional fields, while also underpinning the functioning of many smartphone applications, software packages and online services. While most people are exposed to these models and interact with them in some form or the other, very few fully understand their functioning and underlying processes. Moreover, in recent years, machine learning algorithms have become increasingly sophisticated and complex, making the processes behind their predictions harder to explain even for experienced computer scientists. To increase people's trust in these highly advanced and promising computational tools , some research teams have been trying to create what is known as explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). These are essentially machine learning models that can explain, at least in part, how they reached a given conclusion or what ""features"" of data they focused on when making a particular prediction. While XAI techniques could be more robust and reliable, most of them have not achieved particularly promising results, as their explanations often leave room for interpretation. Researchers at University of California-Irvine and Harvard University recently developed TalkToModel, an interactive dialog system designed to explain machine learning models and their predictions both to engineers and non-expert users. Their platform, introduced in Nature Machine Intelligence , allows users to receive simple and relevant answers to their questions about AI models and their functioning. ""We were interested in finding ways to better enable interpretability of models,"" Dylan Slack, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told Tech Xplore. ""However, practitioners often struggle to use interpretability tools. So, we thought it could be better if we let practitioners 'talk' to machine learning models directly."" The recent study by Slack and his colleagues builds on their earlier works focusing on XAI and human-AI interaction. Its key objective was to introduce a new platform that would explain AI to users in a simple and accessible way, similarly to how OpenAI's conversational platform ChatGPT answers questions. Their system has three key components: an adaptive dialog engine, an execution unit and a conversational interfaced. The adaptive dialog engine was trained to interpret input texts in natural language and generate sensible responses to these texts. The execution component essentially composes the ""AI explanations"" that are then translated into accessible words and sent to users. Finally, the conversational interface is essentially the software through which users can type their prompts and view answers. ""TalkToModel is a system for enabling open ended conversations with machine learning models,"" Slack explained. ""You simply ask the system a question about why your model does something and get an answer. This makes it easy for anyone to understand models."" To determine whether users might find their system useful, the team asked different professionals and students to test it and share their feedback. Overall, most of their study participants found it somewhat useful and interesting, with 73% of participating health care workers stating that they would use it to better understand the predictions of an AI-based diagnostic tool , and 85% of machine learning developers confirming that it was easier to use than other XAI tools. In the future, this platform could be improved further and released to the public. This could contribute to ongoing efforts aimed at increasing people's understanding of AI and their overall trust in its predictions. ""The findings of our studies on humans, including graduate students, machine learning engineers, and health care workers were really interesting,"" Slack added. ""They suggested that the system could be quite useful for anyone to understand models and how they worked. We now hope to keep exploring ways to use more advanced AI systems, such as ChatGPT style models, to improve experiences with this type of system.""

"At least 700 killed in devastating floods in Libya; 10,000 reported missing","Emergency workers uncovered hundreds of bodies as they dug through the wreckage of Libya’s eastern city of Derna on September 12, and 10,000 people were reported still missing after floodwaters broke through dams and smashed through the city, washing away entire neighborhoods. At least 700 recovered bodies have been buried so far, the Health Minister for eastern Libya said. Derna’s ambulance authority put the current death toll at 2,300. But the toll is likely to be far higher, in the thousands, said Tamer Ramadan, Libya envoy for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. He told a U.N. briefing in Geneva via videoconference from Tunisia that at least 10,000 people were still missing. The destruction came to Derna and other parts of eastern Libya on September 10 night, when Mediterranean storm Daniel pounded the coast. Residents said they heard loud explosions and realised that dams outside the city had collapsed, unleashing flash floods down Wadi Derna, a river running from the mountains through the city and into the sea. The wall of water sweeping through Derna “erased everything in its way,” said one resident, Ahmed Abdalla. Videos posted online by residents showed large swaths of mud and wreckage where the raging waters had swept away the residential neighborhoods on both banks of the river. Multi-storey apartment buildings that once were well back from the river had facades ripped away and concrete floors collapsed. Cars lifted by the water were left dumped on top of each other. Residents in the city of some 90,000 were on their own in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, with authorities in eastern Libya saying they were unable to reach Derna. On September 12, most of the eastern government had arrived in the city. Local emergency responders, including troops, government workers, volunteers and residents were digging through rubble to recover the dead. They also used inflatable boats to retrieve bodies from the water. Footage showed dozens of bodies covered by blankets laid out in the yard of a hospital in Derna. Many bodies were believed trapped under rubble or had been washed out into the Mediterranean Sea, said eastern Libya’s Health Minister Othman Abduljaleel. “We were stunned by the amount of destruction... the tragedy is very significant, and beyond the capacity of Derna and the government,” Mr. Abduljaleel told The Associated Press on the phone from Derna. Red Crescent teams from other parts of Libya also arrived in Derna on September 8 morning but extra excavators and other equipment had yet to get there, hampered in part by cutoff and destroyed roads. Authorities said two dams on Wadi Derna had collapsed, underscoring the weakness of Libya’s infrastructure after more than a decade of chaos. The oil-rich nation remains divided between two rival administrations: one in the east and one in the west, each backed by different militias and foreign governments. Derna is controlled by the forces of military commander Khalifa Hifter, the strongman of the east Libya government, based in Benghazi. Local authorities have neglected Derna for years, often discussing developing it but never acting, said Jalel Harchaoui, an associate fellow specialising in Libya at the London-based Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies. “Even the maintenance aspect was simply absent. Everything kept being delayed,” he said. Aid also began to come into a staging ground in Benghazi, 250 km west of Derna. Egyptian military officials arrived in Benghazi along with a rescue team and helicopters. The Tripoli-based government of western Libya sent a plane with 14 tons of medical supplies and health workers to Benghazi. U.S. Special Envoy for Libya Richard Norland said on X platform, formerly known as Twitter, that the United States is coordinating with the United Nations and local authorities to assess how best to target official U.S. assistance. Tunisia, Algeria, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates also promised help for search and rescue efforts. The storm hit other areas in eastern Libya, including the town of Bayda, where about 50 people were reported dead. The Medical Center of Bayda, the main hospital, was flooded and patients had to be evacuated, according to footage shared by the center on Facebook. Other towns that suffered, included Susa, Marj and Shahatt, according to the government. Hundreds of families were displaced and took shelter in schools and other government buildings in the city of Benghazi and elsewhere in eastern Libya. Northeast Libya is one of the country’s most fertile and green regions. The Jabal al-Akhdar area — where Bayda, Marj and Shahatt are located — has one of the country’s highest average annual rainfalls, according to the World Bank. Known for its white-painted houses and palm gardens, Derna was largely built by Italy when Libya was under Italian occupation in the first half of the 20th century. The city was once a hub for extremist groups in the yearslong chaos that followed the NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime dictator Muammar Qadhafi in 2011.",world

"Researchers Discover 24,000-Year-Old Palaeolithic Cave Art In Spain","Researchers said that the site probably contains the largest number of individual designs A team of archaeologists have discovered a Paleolithic cave art site in Spain. The site has more than a hundred individual designs. According to a study published in the journal Antiquity , the collection of prehistoric paintings and engravings is thought to be, more than 24,000 years old. The archaeologists found the artwork in a 1,600-foot-deep cave known as ""Cova Dones"" -or ""Cueva Dones""-located in the municipality of Millares in Spain's eastern Valencia region, Newsweek reported. ""When we saw the first painted auroch [extinct wild bull], we immediately acknowledged it was important. Although Spain is the country with the largest number of Palaeolithic cave art sites, most of them are concentrated in northern Spain. Eastern Iberia is an area where few of these sites have been documented so far,"" said Dr Aitor Ruiz-Redondo, Senior Lecturer of Prehistory at the University of Zaragoza and a research affiliate at the University of Southampton. ""The actual 'shock' of realizing its significance came long after the first discovery, he said. ""Once we began the proper systematic survey we realised we were facing a major cave art site, like the ones that can be found elsewhere in Cantabrian Spain, southern France or Andalusia, but that totally lack in this territory."" The researchers said that the site probably contains the largest number of individual designs, or motifs, discovered at any Paleolithic site in Europe since the 2015 findings at the Atxurra cave in Spain's northern Basque region. Detailing on the animal designs, the researchers said that it includes depictions of hinds, horses, aurochs and deer. Most of the paintings were usually made using clay-a rare find at Paleolithic sites. ""Animals and signs were depicted simply by dragging the fingers and palms covered with clay on the walls,"" Ruiz-Redondo said. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com ""The humid environment of the cave did the rest: the 'paintings' dried quite slowly, preventing parts of the clay from falling down rapidly, while other parts were covered by calcite layers, which preserved them until today,"" he said.

"""Life Won't Be Same..."": Morocco Quake Survivors Recall Unbearable Pain","Morocco Earthquake: Around 2,900 people have been killed in a deadly quake that hit Morocco on Friday After cheating death himself and escaping the rubble, Abdellah Aeet Bihi found his youngest son, aged four, alive but trapped after Morocco's earthquake. The boy was still able to talk from under the rubble of their collapsed house. ""But I couldn't get to him,"" Bihi, 39, recalled in their village of Talat Nyacoub, destroyed by the Friday night quake. On Monday the body of his son was finally freed, Bihi said, breaking into sobs. The little one had died near his elder brother, aged 12. ""I saw the elder one, lifeless. I quickly realised that stones had landed on the top of his body."" Bihi, 39, said he had been hoping for a peaceful sleep ""when the roof fell on top of us"". An amputee, Bihi uses a prosthesis on his left arm but lost it during the chaos. Somehow, with help from neighbours, ""I was able to extract my 10-year-old daughter and my wife"" from the debris. His eldest child, 14, also got out. ""I don't know how,"" he recalled. Along with his two boys, Bihi's parents also died in the quake which killed around 2,900 people. ""My tears don't dry. I want them to stop but the pain is stronger than anything,"" he said. His wife looked at him with silent sadness and wept. What remains of the family has taken refuge at the entrance to their remote village in the Atlas mountains near the quake epicentre, south of Marrakesh. Under olive trees, they share a rug with the family of Latifa Aeet Bizli. The roof of her house also collapsed in the earthquake, but Bizli was able to save her youngsters, aged three, seven and 10, as well as her parents-in-law. ""Luckily we were upstairs. I got hold of my children and was able to get them out through a hole,"" recalled Bizli, whose husband was in another village at the time, and also survived. ""I went back while the earth was still shaking to get my parents-in-law out."" With the family safely outside, she took in the extent of the shocking devastation around her. All the homes were destroyed, including her sister's. ""She died with her husband and her two children. I couldn't do anything for her and am eaten up by remorse because of it. I still can't accept that they are no longer here,"" said Bizli, 30. ""Life will never be the same for us,"" she said, grateful that aid had arrived to help them survive in what was already a deprived village. In a spirit of solidarity after the quake, many ordinary Moroccans have stepped in to deliver medicine, food, quilts and mattresses to stricken villages, as some people complained authorities were slow to act. Another resident of Talat Nyacoub, Rachida Aeet Malek, feels lucky to be alive after spending six hours in the rubble of her home. When the quake struck she was upstairs along with her two children, mother and two sisters -- one of them pregnant. Only her nephew was downstairs, said Malek, who is in her 20s. ""Three of our neighbours got us out from under the debris,"" she said. Malek was the last to be freed, she said, lying under a tree with her children. Her sisters were hospitalised but she is unhurt, physically. ""I am still in shock. I can't describe the pain inside me since this drama. We came back from the edge of death."" Her nephew didn't.

"PAUL Brings Fine French Flavours To Mumbai, With A Decadent Edge","PAUL Mumbai Restaurant Review: Phoenix Palladium Mall in Lower Parel is home to an exclusive list of global brands that never fails to draw crowds from all over the city. The newest addition to this list is French culinary brand PAUL, an artisanal bakery and all-day dining restaurant, located on one side of the mall's courtyard. With its Mumbai opening, PAUL marks its foray into the western part of the country - its other outlets are located in Delhi and Gurugram. We got the chance to visit this chic restaurant recently and sample a few of its dishes. Here is what we recommend: The Croque Monsieur. Photo Credit: Toshita Sahni We began with a Croque Monsieur , a classic French ham and cheese sandwich. Paul's version comes with a side of home-style fries and a simple salad. What stood out first was the size of the sandwich, almost 3 times that of a regular bread slice! We enjoyed digging into the yummy layers which were fused with an expert hand. PAUL salad. Photo Credit: Toshita Sahni Another favourite of the evening was the signature PAUL Salad - a refreshing combination of greens (mainly lettuce), green apple slices, and Emmental cheese, topped with a generous serving of chicken. The dressing was a light vinaigrette, which was a subtle delight. We loved how the crispness of the apple, the juiciness of the chicken and the nuttiness of the walnut came together. This is a dish worth returning for. Another treat with green apples we relished was the Pomme Vanille Spritzer . This mocktail is a concoction of apple juice, vanilla syrup and soda, with fresh apple slices and mint leaves. It is delicately tart and undeniably rejuvenating. We also tried the signature Infusion - a medley of grapefruit syrup, orange juice and soda, with orange slices and kaffir lime leaves. It was sweet like a mixed fruit juice. This drink's a safe choice that seemed to be popular among patrons, but we preferred the Spritzer. One section of the baked items and desserts. Photo Credit: Toshita Sahni PAUL has some delectable hot beverages too, including different types of coffee and a hot chocolate everyone seemed to be asking for. Served in wide mugs, they seem perfectly crafted to allow you to dunk a buttery croissant in it. Note that the food menu also features burgers, pastas, pizzas, egg preparations, soups and various types of sandwiches. For the main course, there is a dedicated section for rice and seafood dishes, which are mainly inspired by classic French flavours. Pain au chocolat almond. Photo Credit: Toshita Sahni Deciding which desserts to try was a dilemma unlike any we've encountered before. There were just too many choices, from famous delicacies like creme brulee and eclairs to lesser-known ones like millefeuille and tarte normande. We finally zeroed in on a classic with a twist: Pain Au Chocolat Almond . It struck a perfect balance between the oozy chocolate filling, the buttery and flaky pastry, and the crunch of almonds on top. Rich and decadent, we were left craving for more. Another must-try is the Blueberry Cheesecake . Here, blueberry flavour is infused into the cream cheese as well - apart from the usual topping of blueberry preserve. The base also had a great texture and no overpowering flavour. Blueberry Cheesecake. Photo Credit: Toshita Sahni PAUL impressed us with their generous servings of elegant dishes as well as crowd favourites. We also appreciated the range of options, whether we talk about sweet treats, savoury delicacies or beverages. If you like French cuisine, enjoy decadent baked items or require a hearty meal, a visit to PAUL in Mumbai will not disappoint.

"2,000 Killed In Massive Flood In East Libya, Thousands Missing: Officials","The United Nations in Libya said it would provide urgent relief to the flood-hit nation Authorities in eastern Libya said at least 2,000 people were killed and thousands more were missing after a massive flood ripped through the city of Derna following a heavy storm and rain. Ahmed Mismari, the spokesperson for the Libyan National Army (LNA) that controls eastern Libya, said in a televised news conference that the disaster came after dams above Derna had collapsed, ""sweeping whole neighbourhoods with their residents into the sea"". Mismari put the number of missing at 5,000-6,000. Earlier on Monday, the head of the Red Crescent aid group in the region had said Derna's death count was at 150 and expected to hit 250. Reuters could not immediately verify either figure. Libya is politically divided between east and west and public services have crumbled since a 2011 NATO-backed uprising that prompted years of conflict. The internationally recognised government in Tripoli does not control eastern areas. In Tripoli, the three-person Presidential Council which functions as head of state in the divided country asked the international community to help. ""We call on brotherly and friendly countries and international organisations to provide assistance,"" it said. Osama Hamad, the head of a parallel eastern-based administration, told local television that more than 2,000 were dead and thousands more missing. After pummelling Greece last week, Storm Daniel swept in over the Mediterranean on Sunday, swamping roads and destroying buildings in Derna, and hitting other settlements along the coast, including Libya's second-biggest city of Benghazi. Videos of Derna showed a wide torrent running through the city centre where a far narrower waterway had previously flowed. Ruined buildings stood on either side. Eastern Libya's Almostkbal TV broadcast footage that showed people stranded on the roofs of their vehicles calling for help and waters washing away cars. ""The missing are in the thousands, and the dead exceed 2,000,"" Osama Hamad told al-Masar TV. ""Entire neighbourhoods in Derna have disappeared, along with their residents ... swept away by water."" Mismari said seven members of the LNA had died in the flood. Derna resident Saleh al-Obaidi said he had managed to flee with his family, though houses in a valley near the city had collapsed. ""People were asleep and woke up and found their homes surrounded by water,"" he told Reuters. Ahmed Mohamed, another resident, said: ""We were asleep, and when we woke up, we found water besieging the house. We are inside and trying to get out."" Witnesses said the water level had reached three metres (10 feet). West of Derna, visuals showed a collapsed road between the port town of Sousse and Shahat, home to the Greek-founded and UNESCO-listed archaeological site Cyrene. Libya's eastern-based parliament declared three days of mourning. Abdulhamid al-Dbeibah, prime minister of the interim government in Tripoli, also declared three days of mourning in all the affected cities, calling them ""disaster areas"". Four major oil ports in Libya - Ras Lanuf, Zueitina, Brega and Es Sidra - were closed from Saturday evening for three days, two oil engineers told Reuters. Search-and-rescue operations were ongoing, witnesses said. Authorities declared a state of extreme emergency, closing schools and stores and imposing a curfew. In Tripoli, the interim government directed all state agencies to ""immediately deal"" with the damage and floods in eastern cities, but the administration has no sway in the east. However, Dbeibah's government works closely with the Central Bank of Libya, which disburses funds to government departments across the country. The United Nations in Libya said it was following the storm closely and would ""provide urgent relief assistance in support of response efforts at local and national levels"". Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani instructed the government to send aid to the affected area in eastern Libya, Qatar's state news agency reported.

Apple Watch 9 announced with gesture controls and double the brightness,"Apple has announced the Apple Watch Series 9 at today's Apple September event – follow our Apple event 2023 live blog for the latest from the show. This story is still developing, but see all the latest below… It features a screen that's twice as bright as what came before, while also darker – it can reach 2000 nits at maximum, and can go as dim as one nit. It will also have more advanced gesture controls, detecting how you've moved your hands. This feature is called 'Double Tap', and you can use it to control your Apple Watch without touching it, so you can answer a phone call or silence an alarm using just the hand your Watch is on – you just double pinch your fingers. The Apple Watch Series 9 will feature a new S9 processor which promises a ""big boost in performance"", though with the same 18 hours of battery life. The new chip can process some Siri requests on the Watch, making it more responsive for voice control. You can also ask Siri about health data, or log health data through Siri – though this is coming ""later this year"". You can also now use Ultra Wideband tech to be guided precisely to your phone if you've misplaced it – an arrow will point the way. The new Watch 9 comes in a lovely soft pink color in the aluminum finish. It's also available in Starlight, Silver, Midnight and (Product) Red in aluminum. In steel, it's available in Gold, Silver and Graphite. Apple will also no longer use leather, and has developed 'FineWoven' instead, which is made from 68% recycled material and promises a suede-like feel. This is a bigger update than we expected! Doubling the brightness is a serious upgrade to the screen, and you'll be amazed at how vibrant that makes it on bright days. And Double Tap looks like a genuinely smart and useful addition – it just makes sense to offer a way to respond to your Watch when your other hand is full. (Certain TR team members are very good as using their nose for this currently…) It's a bit of a shame that the S9 chip doesn't mean longer battery life, though Apple massively undersells what the Apple Watch Series 8 can do, so we're sure that will be the case again here. The Apple Watch 9 starts from $399 and is available to order today, with release on September 22, 2023, please?",technology
"Prajakta Koli reveals that she agreed to do Yeh Shaadi Nahi Ho Sakti because of Akarsh Khurana; says, “I always wanted to work with him outside of the Netflix universe”","Prajakta Koli, who has been exploring films and web series apart from being a digital influencer, recently opened up collaborating with Akarsh Khurana once again after the success of their previous show Mismatched. The actress featured her in the role of a bubbly girl in the show Yeh Shaadi Nahi Ho Sakti, which released earlier this month on ZEE5 and the actress, too, received a lot of love from audience for her character.

More than understanding the fact that it's a Shakespearean comedy that was adapted with the David Dhawan twist, I think for me it was just the fact that Akarsh Khurana was making it.” Further elaborating on the reason behind her signing up for her role as Priya, Prajakta added, “My character is great, I think the fact that she's so filmy, so dramatic, and so extra, and the fact that her reaction to everything is so over the top is fun for me.” Besides this, the actress was also seen in the Vidya Balan starrer Neeyat and talking about exploring different mediums and juggling between multiple projects, Prajakta revealed, “It is my YouTube community that got me this life where I get to be an actor as well, so I don't think it's as much a balancing as it is being in a position where I get to do so much work every day. I don't really think I have reached that point or that place where things are getting overwhelming. I think over the past eight years I have also found ways of kind of balancing everything and finding my groove through doing multiple things at the same time.

"iPhone 15 Series, Apple Watch Ultra 2, Watch Series 9: Everything Launched at Apple Event 2023","launched its brand new iPhone 15 series and new Apple Watch series at its September 12 event in Cupertino, California. In case you missed our , here's a look at all the main products that were announced at the event. One of the main themes of the event was sustainability as Apple claimed it's using even more recycled metals in its devices this year, and that some of its new smartwatches are now carbon neutral. The rumours were also right about the switch to USB Type-C. All of the new iPhones and the AirPods Pro (2nd gen) feature a USB Type-C connector. Here's everything that Apple announced along with their prices in India. The starts at Rs. 79,900 while the starts at Rs. 89,900, both having 128GB of base storage. The and now start at Rs. 69,900 and Rs. 79,900 respectively. The iPhone 15 will be up for preorder from September 15 and will go on sale from September 22. The borrows some of the features from the iPhone 14 Pro series such as Dynamic Island, A16 Bionic processor, and the primary 48-megapixel camera. However, other pro features such as the 120Hz refresh rate and telephoto camera are still reserved for the Pro models. Apple claims the new iPhone 15 duo uses 75 percent recycled aluminium for the body and 100 percent recycled cobalt in the battery. The new smartphones will be available in pink this time, in addition to more mellow shades of blue, yellow, green and black. The and get some this year, and differ when it comes to their respective telephoto cameras. The iPhone 15 Pro starts at Rs. 1,34,900 for 128GB of storage, while the iPhone 15 Pro Max starts at Rs. 1,59,900 for 256GB of storage. It's worth noting that the series has been officially discontinued, although you'll still be able to buy it via Apple's resellers. Apple has ditched the gold colour for the 15 Pro models for a “natural” shade, along with blue, white and black. The iPhone 15 Pro will be up for preorder from September 15 and will go on sale from September 22. The big design change for the iPhone 15 Pro models is the switch to titanium for the frame, instead of stainless steel. Apple says it has used Grade 5 titanium which is supposed to be lighter and stronger than the 14 Pro series. Another big design change on the pro models is that the mute switch has now been replaced with an ‘Action button.' This button can perform the original function of putting the iPhone in silent mode when long-pressed, but it can also be programmed to open the camera, start a voice recording, and much more. The next big upgrade is with the processor. The iPhone 15 Pro series use Apple's A17 Pro SoC which is built on a “industry-first” 3nm fabrication process. It packs 16 billion transistors and features a 6-core CPU, 6-core GPU, and support for hardware-level ray tracing in games. Apple has also used a high-speed USB 3.0 controller for the Type-C port in the Pro models, which promise to deliver up to 10Gbps of bandwidth. However, in typical Apple fashion, you'll need an optional high-speed USB Type-C cable to take advantage of this. The cameras are the third big upgrade. The new iPhone 15 Pros feature an improved primary 48-megapixel sensor which now offers more professional focal length options of 24mm, 28mm and 35mm, to choose from. There's also a special nano coating on the lenses that's supposed to reduce lens flare. The new iPhones (including the non-Pro models) support Smart HDR 5 for improved dynamic range and colours in stills. The iPhone 15 Pro Max gets an upgrade telephoto camera. It's still a 12-megapixel sensor with a f/2.8 aperture but it now uses a “tetra prism” to channel light to the sensor, thereby giving the camera an effective 5X optical zoom instead of 3X zoom. The iPhone 15 Pro still has a 3X optical zoom for its telephoto camera. Apple also says the new Pro models are the first smartphones to support the ACES (Academy Colour Encoding System) colour grading standard which is used by professional filmmakers. Another new feature which could play a big part user generated content for is Spatial Videos. The new iPhone 15 Pro models can record spatial videos which uses the main and ultra-wide cameras to capture footage. This feature will be enabled later this year via a software update. The replaces the . It starts at Rs. 41,900 while the starts at Rs. 29,900. The Watch Series 9 will be available in aluminium and stainless steel, and in 41mm and 45mm case sizes. Multiple colour options are on offer, and the watch will go on sale on September 22 in India. The Apple Watch Series 9 doesn't look any different from the Series 8, but it does feature a new Apple S9 processor which is said to enable faster on-device Siri. There's also a second-gen Ultra-wide band (UWB) chip which now allows you to locate your iPhone near you or activate the Music widget on the watch when you bring it near a . The Series 9's display now supports up to 2,000 nits of brightness and can go as low as 1 nit. One of the coolest features enabled by the S9 chip is double-tap. This uses multiple sensors in the watch to detect when you make a double tap gesture with your thumb and forefinger. You can use this to answer or reject calls, browse through widgets, and more — all without ever touching the screen. Apple says it has stopped using real leather for all of its accessories, which incudes watch straps. There's a new FineWoven material which consists of 65 percent PCR materials. Apple also updated its Ultra watch, calling it the . It is priced at Rs. 89,900 and will be available in India on September 22. It too sports the new S9 processor, double-tap gesture, quicker on-device Siri, etc. The display now goes up to 3,000 nits and comes with a new Modular Ultra watch face. It gets refreshed loop bands too with more eco-friendly materials. For the latest and , follow Gadgets 360 on , , and . For the latest videos on gadgets and tech, subscribe to our .",technology
Coca-Cola embraces controversial AI image generator with new “Y3000” flavor,"Enlarge Coca-Cola reader comments 32 with Coca-Cola has taken a fizzy leap into the future of AI hype with the release of Coca-Cola Y3000 Zero Sugar, a ""limited-edition"" beverage reportedly co-created with artificial intelligence. Its futuristic name evokes flavor in the year 3000 (still 977 years away), but its marketing relies on AI-generated imagery from 2023—courtesy of the controversial image synthesis model Stable Diffusion . Further Reading AI-powered grocery bot suggests recipe for toxic gas, “poison bread sandwich” Stable Diffusion, a technology which is mentioned by name when launching the ""Coca-Cola Y3000 AI Cam"" mobile app, gained its ability to generate images by scraping hundreds of millions of copyrighted works found on the Internet without copyright holder permission and is currently the subject of litigation related to copyright infringement. But there is no hint of that controversy in Coca-Cola's marketing materials, which lean heavily into today's buzzy, AI-centered tech zeitgeist. ""We hope that Coca-Cola will still be as relevant and refreshing in the year 3000 as it is today, so we challenged ourselves to explore the concept of what a Coke from the future might taste like—and what kind of experiences would a Coke from the future unlock?"" Oana Vlad, Coke's senior director of global strategy, said in a press release. Enlarge / An AI-augmented QR code provided by Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola To explore that hypothetical future, Coca-Cola developed a mystery flavor and wrapped it in an AI-themed marketing package and mobile web-based app that draws upon both human designers and the aforementioned Stable Diffusion. There's no direct reference to AI being used to develop the flavor beyond this one statement: ""Fans’ perspectives from around the world, combined with insights gathered from artificial intelligence, helped inspire Coca-Cola to create the unique taste of Y3000."" Advertisement The lack of an AI mixologist at the helm is probably a good thing because AI has been known to concoct questionable recipes . Nobody needs toxic ingredients accidentally confabulated into their soda recipe. (Would Coca-Cola feed its vaulted top-secret recipe through a commercial cloud AI model, such as ChatGPT, anyway?) While there may be no AI flavors involved, the company talks about using AI to develop Y3000's graphical branding: ""Coca-Cola Y3000 Zero Sugar sports an equally futuristic—and optimistic—visual identity. Co-created with artificial intelligence, the design showcases liquid in a morphing, evolving state, communicated through form and color changes that emphasize a positive future.""

On its website, Coca-Cola provides an AI-augmented QR code (likely generated with a recently discovered Stable Diffusion technique). When scanned on a mobile phone, the code takes thirsty users to the "" Coca-Cola Creations Hub ,"" where they can take photos with their device camera and filter them through Stable Diffusion to have a vaporwave-style futuristic look. As it stands today, the term ""artificial intelligence"" is a technical term of art , yet it's also arguably sometimes meaningless due to misunderstandings and misuse.

The physics of saltwater taffy,"Enlarge / Saltwater taffy is made by stretching and pulling the sticky candy base to create air bubbles for a fluffy and chewy confection. Wikimedia/CC BY-SA 3.0 reader comments 10 with When San To Chan successfully defended their PhD thesis, they received a gift of saltwater taffy to celebrate and couldn't help being intrigued by the taffy's unusual consistency: somewhere between a solid and liquid. That led to experiments investigating the taffy's rheology—how it deforms in response to applied forces—and how the ingredients and taffy-making process contribute to that rheology. The results are described in a new paper published in the journal Physics of Fluids. “Taffy is a viscoelastic material—it has properties between a viscous liquid and an elastic solid,"" said Chan , now a postdoc in the Fluid Interfaces Group at MIT Media Lab. ""Comparing the deformation behavior of commercial taffy to those of different lab-made sugar syrups and lab-made taffies allowed us to identify the most important taffy ingredient (and material structure) that governs taffy rheology.” It's just the latest example of a burgeoning area of research focusing on the science of food—something that's frequently on the menu here at Ars. For instance, in 2020 , physicists examined the physics of wok-tossed fried rice and found that the secret to a perfect dish (i.e., nicely browned but not burnt) was a timely combination of side-to-side and see-sawing motions while cooking. In 2022, MIT physicists coined the term ""oreology"" for their study of why—when twisting two Oreo cookie halves apart—the creme filling typically sticks to only one chocolate wafer. Further Reading MIT scientists crack the case of breaking spaghetti in two The pandemic inspired physicists from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to investigate the physics of cooking pasta—first conducting home experiments, then repeating those with greater precision in the lab once the university reopened after lockdown. The most surprising finding was that the pasta noodles increased in length the longer they were cooked. There have been a surprisingly large number of scientific papers seeking to understand the various properties of spaghetti, both cooking and eating it—the mechanics of slurping the pasta into one's mouth, for instance; spitting it out (aka, the ""reverse spaghetti problem""); or exploring the question of how to get dry spaghetti strands to break neatly in two , rather than three or more scattered pieces. Advertisement Earlier this year, scientists explored whether making kimchi in traditional earthenware vessels known as onggi results in the best kimchi. Answer: it does ; the porosity of the onggi's walls help the most desired bacteria proliferate during the fermentation process. Other scientists have studied the structure of cheese; investigated the composition and flow of gluten-free batter and breads; discovered why strands of honey can get so long and thin as they drip without actually breaking; figured out a way to get cocoa butter to distribute more evenly in chocolate to enhance the perceived texture; studied why Brazil nuts rise to the top of a can of mixed nuts (aka the "" Brazil nut effect ""); and figured out how to ""tune"" the flow of Swiss cheese fondue by adding cornflour or wine. Enlarge / (left) Saltwater taffies of different flavors. (right) 3D model reconstructed by X-ray computed tomography, illustrating immiscible inclusions (oil droplets and air bubbles) in the grape-flavored taffy. Chan et al. ""Studying the physical principles associated with manipulating different foods might, in turn, stimulate discoveries of scientific, engineering, and engineering importance,"" Chan et al . wrote in their paper. In the case of saltwater taffy, a better understanding of its rheology, as well as that of other sugar-based confections, could enable artisans ""to manipulate the material better, leading to novel techniques for creating designs with high artistic and cultural value, as well as enhanced control of their texture and mouthfeel."" Saltwater taffy is a bit of a misnomer in that salt water isn't an ingredient. Taffy is just sugar, corn starch (for a smooth texture), corn syrup and butter (as interfering agents to keep the sugar from crystallizing), glycerine (for a creamy consistency), salt, water, food coloring, and flavorings. The (likely apocryphal) story behind the name involves an Atlantic City candy store owner in the 1880s named David Bradley. His store on the boardwalk flooded in 1883, soaking his products, and when a little girl came in asking for a piece of candy, Bradley joked that all he had was ""saltwater taffy."" The name stuck, and the candy became immensely popular; it's still a staple of US coastal towns. The basic taffy ingredients are combined and brought to a boil—traditionally in copper kettles—then laid out on marble slabs to cool. When it is cool enough to handle, the taffy is pulled and stretched into large bands, trapping air between the layers to ensure the final candy stays soft and chewy. Early on, this was done by hand in so-called ""taffy pulls,"" but as the 20th century dawned, there were many US patents for taffy-pulling machines to handle this strenuous work.",technology

The main camera sensor is moving to a 48-megapixel one, up from the 12-megapixel one found on the previous iPhone 14. There’s also a 12-megapixel telephoto, and improvements to the portrait mode mean you won’t have to manually switch to portrait mode anymore, reported The Verge. The iPhone 15 will come with a 6.1-inch screen while iPhone 15 Plus comes with a 6.7-inch screen. Both versions will be available in pink, yellow, green, blue, and black colors. The iPhone 15 is priced starting at USD 799 for a 128GB model and the iPhone 15 Plus starts at USD 899 for a 128GB version. The 15 Pro starts at USD 999 with 128GB of storage, and the Pro Max at USD 1,199 with 256GB of storage. Both will be available for preorder this Friday and on sale September 22, as per The Verge. Both are powered by the A17 Pro chip, which Apple says has the fastest performance in any smartphone and can even challenge some high-end PCs. Along with a redesigned GPU, Apple seems to think these devices could be poised to level up the kinds of games you can play on your phone. Also, both phones have a USB-C port on the bottom rather than the old Lightning port, reported The Verge. Interestingly, the ring/silent switch is gone, replaced with an ""Action Button"". With the new, button that you can customize to run shortcuts, bring up accessibility features, open the camera, turn on the flashlight, and more. The Pros both have Super Retina XDR displays with ProMotion and support both the always-on display and the new StandBy mode in iOS 17. iPhone 15 Series Launch: All the New Features That Are Expected in iPhone 15 Series Model and More. Camera functions have been improved. On the iPhone 15 Pro Max (but not the regular iPhone 15 Pro), there’s a new telephoto camera, with a new tetra-prism design, increasing the zoom up to 5x (the iPhone 15 Pro maxes out at 3x). But the main, wide camera, as well as the ultrawide camera (which are the same on both the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max) have received significant improvements as well. According to a report by US-based tech portal TechCrunch, the new smartwatch is powered by the new S9 chip, which the company claims its 60 per cent faster, coupled with a 30 per cent faster GPU. WatchOS 10 offers the new ‘Name Drop’ feature, which allows users to share personal information when close to another user with the same device. Another new and significant feature, ‘Double Tap’ is one of the more interesting features this time. It’s a new input system back into the chip that detects small movements and blood flow when the user taps their index finger and thumb together. By just tapping the fingers, a user can answer a call, end a call, stop a timer, play music, scroll through the widgets, and turn off an alarm. The price of a Series 9 watch with GPS will be USD 399 and GPS with cellular, will be priced at USD 499. Like the new Series 9, the Ultra 2 will be powered by Apple’s S9 SiP, which has 5.6 billion transistors and a four-core neural engine as well as a U2 ultra wideband location chip. This will enable new advanced features, including on-device Siri processing and more precise location tracking. And we talk about the outer side of the watch, it has an upgraded display from the previous Ultra model, rated for 3,000 nits, which Apple says is the brightest display an Apple Watch has ever had. Apple claimed that users will get 72 hours to charge when the device is in low-power mode. The case is now made from 95 per cent recycled titanium. Some of the biggest changes that Apple Watch users will see this year, will be watchOS 10, which brings widgets, redesigned app icons, and new mapping and cycling features to the watch interface. An additional watch face called ‘Modular Ultra’ will make use of the outer edge of the display. And a new double-tap gesture will enable users to more easily start and end phone calls. The Ultra 2 will be available at USD 799 (approx. 67,000 INR). You can get your hands on this Watch from September 22.

France Orders Apple To Stop iPhone 12 Sales Over Radiation Concerns,"French regulators on Tuesday ordered Apple to halt sales of the iPhone 12 for emitting too much electromagnetic radiation, and to fix existing handsets. The French agency that regulates radio frequencies, the ANFR, said testing found that the model emits more electromagnetic waves susceptible to be absorbed by the body than permitted. The ANFR said it ""ordered Apple to remove the iPhone 12 from the French market from September 12 due to the model exceeding the limit"" for electromagnetic absorption by the body. It said accredited labs had found absorption of electromagnetic energy by the body at 5.74 watts per kilogram during tests simulating when the phone was being held in the hand or kept in a pocket. The European standard is a specific absorption rate of 4.0 watts per kilogram in such tests. ""Concerning phones already sold, Apple must in the briefest of delays take corrective measures to bring the affected phones into compliance,"" said the ANFR in a statement on its website. ""Otherwise, Apple will have to recall them."" ANFR noted that tests that measure the electromagnetic radiation absorbed at a distance of five centimetres was in compliance with the limit of 2.0 watts per kilogram. ANFR said its agents would verify beginning Wednesday that iPhone 12 models were no longer being offered for sale in France. When contacted by AFP, Apple disputed the ANFR's results, saying it had presented multiple independent analyses showing the devices were in compliance, but that the company would nonetheless continue to work with the regulator. Regulators in a number of countries have limits on the amount of electromagnetic radiation mobile phones may emit to prevent adverse health effects. The World Health Organization states on its website that following a large number of studies that ""no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use"". The news from France came the same day that Apple unveiled its new iPhone 15 lineup, the first to feature a universal charging port in place of its unique ""Lightning"" ports after a tussle with European regulators. The EU is insisting that all phones and other small devices must be compatible with the USB-C charging cables from the end of next year, a move it says will reduce waste and save money for consumers. ""USB-C has become a universally accepted standard. So we're bringing USB-C to iPhone 15,"" said Kaiann Drance, Apple's vice president of iPhone marketing at a launch event. The update comes as the Silicon Valley tech giant faces declining iPhone sales, as premium prices push customers to delay switching to newer models. ""Apple needed to deliver more than just minor updates to get people excited about buying new products,"" Techsponential analyst Avi Greengart said in a demo area at the event.

US states paid up to $135 billion of jobless benefits during COVID: Report,"Listen to Story Up to $135 billion of jobless benefits paid out by US states during the coronavirus pandemic may have arisen from fraudulent claims, Washington's top government watchdog said on Tuesday in a report suggesting the problem is much bigger than previously estimated. Waves of fraudulent claims for unemployment insurance benefits have episodically inflated the volumes of new filings reported each week to the Labor Department by all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, often confounding economists tracking the data for a read on the health of the job market. But a new General Accountability Office report estimates the problem is much bigger: Between $100 billion and $135 billion of the roughly $900 billion in jobless benefits payouts from April 2020 through May 2023 may have been fraudulent. At the high end, that would equal about $1 of every $7 paid in aid over that time. The GAO's fraud estimate is around two times or more higher than the nearly $56 billion it said states themselves have estimated paying in either fraudulent payments or nonfraudulent overpayments between March 2020 and March 2023. ""The full extent of UI fraud during the pandemic will likely never be known with certainty,"" the GAO report summary said. The Labor Department disputed the magnitude of the GAO finding, saying it was based on a small sample of questionable claims under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program. The PUA was established under the $2.2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act as US unemployment benefits rolls surged from fewer than 2 million recipients to more than 23 million in a matter of weeks in the spring of 2020 due to lockdowns early in the pandemic. After several extensions, the PUA - which provided benefits to jobless individuals who would not typically have been eligible for them - expired in September 2021. ""For this reason, the Department believes that the GAO's report overestimates the level of fraud and that this report can best be understood as an estimate of UI fraud risk rather than a fraud estimate,"" Brent Parton, the department's principal deputy assistant secretary, wrote to the GAO investigators. Fraudulent claims activity has periodically distorted the data reported weekly by the Labor Department, befuddling economists who count on the data for gauging the wherewithal of the job market. In early May a surge in new benefits claims to the highest level since October 2021 briefly led economists to conclude a long-awaited softening in the labor market was taking hold. The increase soon afterward was attributed almost entirely to a wave of fraudulent claims in Massachusetts, and the initial estimate of claims for that period was later revised down by 32,000, or more than 12%. Another short-lived increase in new claims in August was seen by some economists as related to an increase in fraudulent claims activity in Ohio.",world

"Binance Removes US CEO, Fires Over 100 Employees Amid Crypto Crackdown","Binance US's share of the global market has shrunk to about 0.6% from around 2.39% in April Binance US Chief Executive Officer Brian Shroder has left the crypto trading platform and been replaced on an interim basis by Chief Legal Officer Norman Reed, according to a company spokesperson. The departure comes as the company controlled by embattled digital entrepreneur Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao is eliminating about one third of its workforce, or more than 100 positions, as a regulatory crackdown erodes its business. The exchange, which is formally called BAM Trading Services Inc., was started in 2019 for US users, who are prohibited from using Binance Holdings. It's the second round of job cuts this year at the Miami-based firm as it faces a series of mounting legal and operational challenges. In June, the US Securities and Exchange Commission accused Binance Holdings, Zhao and Binance.US with mishandling customer funds, misleading investors and regulators, and breaking securities rules. Zhao and the companies have denied the allegations. In March, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission charged Binance and Zhao with ""willful evasion of federal law."" The Justice Department is probing Binance as well; it hasn't accused the company of any wrongdoing. Soon after the SEC action, customers of Binance.US became unable to deposit or withdraw dollars, a consequence of multiple banking partners cutting ties with the platform. The company has had to resort to an alternative method for Binance US's users to convert dollars into crypto. Binance US's share of the global market has shrunk to about 0.6% from around 2.39% in April, according to Jacob Joseph, an analyst at researcher CCData. Monthly trading volume has fallen below early 2020 levels, he said. ""The actions we are taking today provide Binance.US with more than seven years of financial runway and enable us to continue to serve our customers while we operate as a crypto-only exchange,"" a spokesperson said in a statement. ""The SEC's aggressive attempts to cripple our industry and the resulting impacts on our business have real world consequences for American jobs and innovation, and this is an unfortunate example of that."" Binance.US laid off an unspecified number of workers after the SEC action, Bloomberg reported in June. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com Binance Holdings has been shedding executives and other employees in recent months as well. This month, two executives overseeing regions including Eastern Europe and Russia left.

"iPhone 15 Pro's Titanium Finish, USB Port Stands Out In First Look","In the first hands-on testing of the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, the new materials and charging port stand out as the most distinct changes from last year's models. The new phones' use of titanium along the sides, which replaces stainless steel, is an attention-grabbing addition. The material is meant to make the phones more lightweight and durable, and that comes across immediately when you hold the device. After unveiling the iPhone 15 lineup on Tuesday, Apple offered demonstrations to attendees at its Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, California. The new product - especially the higher-end versions - represents one of the company's biggest upgrades in years. And Apple is counting on the new features to help reverse a rare sales slump. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook appeared on the demo-room floor, taking selfies with attendees and getting up close and personal with the handsets on display. He has described the iPhone 15 Pro as the culmination of ""Apple innovations, advancing features across design, camera, performance and more."" But much of the attention Tuesday focused on a more mundane change. When grabbing the new phone, attendees immediately flipped the device upside-down to examine the new USB-C port. The connector is a switch from Lightning, which the iPhone has used since 2012, and the change is bound to irk some consumers. But the technology offers faster data-transfer speeds, at least on the higher-end iPhones. And Apple didn't have much of a choice in the matter: The switch to USB-C was mandated by the European Union, and it didn't make sense for Apple to produce a specific iPhone just for that market. Play Video Read More: Apple to Change iPhone Port for First Time in 11 Years Aesthetically, the new connector makes little difference, but the disappearance of the Lightning port still felt like a big occasion for the technology enthusiasts and analysts gathered in the demo room. The sizes of the Pro and Pro Max remain unchanged from the previous generation, at 6.1 inches and 6.7 inches. One twist: The colors on the higher-end phones are actually more muted than on the cheaper iPhones, giving the titanium more of a chance to shine. The entry-level models - the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus - feature pastel versions of pink, blue, green and yellow, in addition to black. Seeing all the models side by side, the regular iPhone colors definitely provide more of a pop. The technology behind the new colors is something Apple highlighted as well. During the presentation, the company explained that metal ions were used to dye color into the glass on the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus. The effect is clearly visible when you hold the phone in your hand and get up close to the frosted glass black. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com Of course, the biggest features of the iPhone 15 Pro are ones you can't immediately see. The A17 chip, Apple's fastest in-house smartphone processor, will make it a more powerful gaming device. It supports a technology called ray tracing - a buzzy topic at the Apple event - that enables smoother graphics and improved color accuracy. Pricing was also a big source of discussion among attendees. Most iPhone models will stay the same level this year, but the Pro Max will get a $100 bump to $1,199. One caveat: The device now starts with 256 gigabytes of storage, compared with 128 on the prior generation.",world
"Over 2,300 Killed In Flood-Hit Libya, Total Deaths Could Surpass 10,000","The floods were caused by torrential rains from Storm Daniel. At least 2,300 people were killed in catastrophic floods that tore through the Libyan city of Derna, the emergency services said Tuesday, but a far higher death count is feared. As global concern spread, multiple nations offered to urgently send aid and rescue teams to help the war-scarred country that has been overwhelmed by what one UN official labelled ""a calamity of epic proportions"". Massive destruction shattered the Mediterranean coastal city of Derna, home to about 100,000 people, where multi-storey buildings on the river banks collapsed and houses and cars vanished in the raging waters. Emergency services under the divided country's internationally recognised government reported an initial death count of more than 2,300 in Derna alone and said over 5,000 people remained missing while about 7,000 were injured. But officials from the rival government in eastern Libya said ""thousands"" more perished in the floods in Derna and that the death count could surpass 10,000. The floods were caused by torrential rains from Storm Daniel, which made landfall in Libya on Sunday after earlier lashing Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey. Derna, 250 kilometres (150 miles) east of Benghazi, is ringed by hills and bisected by what is normally a dry riverbed in summer, but which has turned into a raging torrent of mud-brown water that also swept away several major bridges. ""The death count is huge and might reach thousands,"" said Tamer Ramadan of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, adding 10,000 people were missing. Elsewhere in Libya's east, aid group the Norwegian Refugee Council said ""entire villages have been overwhelmed by the floods and the death count continues to rise"". ""Communities across Libya have endured years of conflict, poverty and displacement. The latest disaster will exacerbate the situation for these people. Hospitals and shelters will be overstretched."" 'Catastrophic' situation Footage on Libyan TV showed dozens of bodies, wrapped in blankets or sheets, on Derna's main square awaiting identification and burial, and more bodies in Martouba village to the southeast. More than 300 victims were buried Monday -- but vastly greater numbers were feared lost in the river that empties into the Mediterranean. The storm also hit Benghazi and the hill district of Jabal al-Akhdar. Flooding, mudslides and other major damage were reported from the wider region, with images showing overturned cars and trucks. Libya's National Oil Corporation, which has its main fields and terminals in eastern Libya, declared ""a state of maximum alert"" and suspended flights between production sites where it said activity was drastically reduced. Oil-rich Libya is still recovering from the years of war and chaos that followed the 2011 NATO-backed popular uprising which toppled and killed longtime dictator Moamer Kadhafi. The country is divided between two rival governments -- the UN-brokered, internationally recognised administration based in Tripoli, and a separate administration in the disaster-hit east. Access to the east is limited. Phone and online links have been largely severed, but the administration's prime minister Oussama Hamad has reported ""more than 2,000 dead and thousands missing"" in Derna alone. A Derna city council official described the situation as ""catastrophic"" and asked for ""national and international intervention"". Aid offers Libya's UN-backed government under Abdelhamid Dbeibah announced three days of national mourning on Monday and emphasised ""the unity of all Libyans"". Aid convoys from Tripoli were heading east and Dbeibah's government announced the dispatch of two ambulance planes and a helicopter, as well as rescue teams, canine search squads and 87 doctors, and technicians to restore power. Rescue teams from Turkey have arrived in eastern Libya, according to authorities, and the UN and several countries offered to send aid, among them Algeria, Egypt, Italy, Qatar and Tunisia. ""Jill and I send our deepest condolences to all the families who have lost loved ones in the devastating floods in Libya,"" US President Joe Biden said in a White House statement, adding his government was sending funds and additional support. Russian President Vladimir Putin also offered his condolences. ""We share the pain and grief of the friendly people of Libya. And of course we are ready to provide the necessary assistance,"" he said in a statement from the Kremlin. France said it had decided to deploy a field hospital that would be operational within 48 hours. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed ""his heartfelt condolences to the Libyan authorities and families of those who have lost their lives as a result of Storm Daniel"", his spokesman said.

Apple's iPhone 15 Price Bump Part Of Subtle Revenue-Boosting Strategy,"Apple Inc. enacted its long-awaited iPhone price increase with as much subtlety as possible, part of an effort to wring more money from consumers without triggering sticker shock. On Tuesday, the company boosted the price of just one iPhone model - the top-end Pro Max, which climbs by $100 to $1,199 - while leaving the other three new versions unchanged. And even the now-costlier new phone will come with twice as much storage, letting Apple argue that it wasn't really a price increase at all. The move fits a pattern for the company, which needs to tread lightly with inflation-wary shoppers. Apple isn't making dramatic changes to its sticker prices, but it's finding new ways for shoppers to spend more. The company is packing its upscale iPhones with exclusive features, such as better zoom lenses and titanium frames, to nudge shoppers toward bigger-ticket items. Even Apple's switch to a USB-C port on the iPhone - an EU-mandated move the company initially opposed - will bring fresh ways to generate revenue. If consumers want their AirPods to have the same connector as the latest iPhones, they'll have to spend $249 for a new pair. If they want to use their old Lightning chargers, they can buy an adapter from Apple for $29. Some investors had hoped that Apple would raise prices more broadly, one reason they gave a cool reaction to Apple's iPhone event Tuesday, according to Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani. The shares slipped 1.7% to $176.30. But Apple is contending with an industrywide smartphone slump, giving it less leverage to increase prices. Worldwide smartphone shipments fell nearly 7% last quarter, according to IDC, hitting the company's biggest source of revenue. Troubles in China, where it faces a widening government ban and competition with an advanced new phone from Huawei Technologies Co., have only added to the pressure. And so, Apple will keep the lower-end version of the iPhone 15 at $799, while the entry-level Pro model remains at $999 - a price that was considered eye-popping when the iPhone X debuted at that level in 2017. Though the starting Pro Max will be nearly 10% more expensive than the cheapest iPhone 14 Pro Max, it has 256 gigabytes of storage, compared with the 128 gigabytes offered previously. Underscoring the incremental nature of this price increase, Apple didn't raise the levels of its iPhone 15 Pro Max models with higher amounts of storage. The version with 512 gigabytes remains at $1,399, while one with 1 terabyte still costs $1,599. But even with prices staying the same, Apple is able to earn higher margins because the cost of storage has fallen. Apple is boosting prices more aggressively outside the US. The iPhone 15 Pro will rise by $50 in Canada, with the Pro Max price going up $200. In India, the Pro Max will climb by about 14%. Some countries, however, are getting a price decrease. In the UK, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are 100 pounds ($125) cheaper than their predecessors. Beyond iPhone pricing tweaks, Apple is generating more revenue from additional services and accessories. The company rolled out two new storage tiers for its iCloud online storage offering: a 6-terabyte plan for $30 a month and a 12-terabyte option for $60 a month. The top-end iCloud plan had been a 2-terabyte offering for $10. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com The new AirPods also reflect Apple's more aggressive approach. When the company began offering wireless charging on the iPhone, it let AirPods customers purchase new cases that used the same format - rather than forcing them to buy all new earbuds. This time around, it's not offering a standalone case that works with USB-C. Buyers of the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max also will need a new cable if they want to get the speedier data transfer speeds promised by the device. Apple is selling one for $69.",world

"""Knew Wellalage Would..."": SL Captain On Spinner's 5-For Against India","Sri Lanka skipper Dasun Shanaka said that he was confident that the young left-arm orthodox spinner Dunith Wellalage would do something special against India after watching his performance against Bangladesh in the Asia Cup 2023. India's bowling attack combined to end Sri Lanka's 13 ODI match unbeaten streak and seal their spot in the final of the Asia Cup 2023 with a game to spare, as the hosts bundled out for 172 chasing a paltry target at the R Premadasa Stadium on Tuesday. While spinners from either side dominated the game, the pacers, too, played a part in India's 41-run victory over the co-hosts. Belligerent Wellalage sliced through India's top order to help Sri Lanka bundle out Men in Blue for 213. Shanaka praised the left-arm orthodox spinner and expressed his confidence in Wellalage's ability to perform admirably against India. ""We didn't expect this kind of wicket, I thought it was a batting wicket but we adjusted well, especially Wellalage, DDS and Asalanka. The luxury of two genuine batters, they have been bowling in the nets and I know their real potential, today I had the option of using them today. Seeing the last game against Bangladesh I knew Wellalage would do something special today, he took Kohli's wicket and I was pretty sure it was his day and he will take a couple more wickets,"" Dasun Shanaka said in a post-match presentation. Youngster Wellalage achieved a remarkable feat as he secured his maiden 5-wicket haul, single-handedly dismantling a formidable Indian batting lineup and bagging the wicket of top batters like Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul and Hardik Pandya. ""First of all I want to congratulate the Indian team. They have so many experienced players but unfortunately, we lost the game but we have another game and we want to put up a good fight. Kuldeep is a great bowler, I tried to play my normal game with a positive mindset. I want to thank my team-mates and my coaching staff - they gave me great support,"" Dunith Wellalage said in a post-match presentation.

Remembering The 'King Of Spin' Shane Warne On His Birth Anniversary,"The 'King of Spin' and Australian spin maestro Shane Warne would have turned 54-years-old on this day (September 13, 2023) had he been alive. The untimely demise of Australian spin maestro Shane Warne at the age of 52 left the sporting world benumbed with shock and grief on March 4 in 2022. Over the course of a golden career, which saw him shatter several records in cricket and set his own, the legendary Australian leg-spinner wowed his fans as much with his flowing blonde mane as with his signature 'flippers' and sharp turners, left an impact on the gentleman's game that is likely to stand the test of time. It was June 4, 1993 at England's Old Trafford. Warne, who had taken just 31 wickets in 11 Test matches up to that point, was preparing to deliver his first ball on English soil. Mike Gatting, a stocky Middlesex batter and a part-time spinner, was fronting up to the Victorian. What followed, and a glut of bowling records thereafter, went a long way in shaping the legacy of the man, who also went by the nickname 'Spin King'. Warne sent down a 'ripper' that castled Gatting around his legs, leaving him dazed and bemused. Also called the 'Ball of the Century', that delivery has since been the stuff of folklore in the much-loved and followed sport. That unforgettable moment in cricketing history was scripted by Warne, then a 23-year-old, in the first Test of the Ashes series at Manchester in 1993. The ball landed wide of leg but spun sharply to knock back Gatting's off-stump. The batter stood at the crease in utter disbelief and it took him a couple of minutes to process what happened. In the Manchester Test, Australia had scored 289 runs in the first innings and it was in England's second vigil at the crease that Warne gave Gatting the shock of his life. The legendary leg-spinner ended up with four wickets in the first innings and four in the second, for a combined haul of 8 wickets in the Test Australia won by 179 runs. Warne passed away on March 4 after a heart attack while vacationing in Thailand. One of the most loved and followed cricketers in history, the Victorian single-handedly reinvented the art of leg-spin when he burst onto the international scene in the early 1990s. Advertisement And, by the time he bid adieu to the sport in 2007, Warne had become the first bowler to collect 700 Test wickets. Warne finished his international career with 708 Test wickets and a further 293 in One-Day Internationals, placing him second on the list of all-time international wicket-takers behind his great friend and rival Muttiah Muralitharan of Sri Lanka at 1,347. Warne, known to his Baggy Green mates as 'Warnie', also captained Australia in 11 One-Day Internationals, winning 10 and losing just once.

Germany beat France 2-1 in a friendly to end its winless run days after removing coach Hansi Flick,"From jeers to cheers inside three days. Germany's Emre Can, left, greets teammate Niklas Sule at the end of the international friendly soccer match against France in Dortmund(AP) Germany beat World Cup runner-up France 2-1 in a friendly on Tuesday in a dramatic turnaround from being whistled by the crowd in a 4-1 loss to Japan on Saturday. That defeat cost Hansi Flick his job as coach the following day. The win lifts some of the gloom around the team hosting the European Championship next year. “We really threw ourselves into it and I think people saw that,” goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen told broadcaster ARD. “These have been strange, difficult days and it was all the better that we could turn things around with the win. I think it gives us confidence and that was what we definitely need right now.” Thomas Müller scored early on and Leroy Sané added a second on a late counterattack, ending the run of five winless games which led to Flick being ousted Sunday. The search is on for a new permanent coach ahead of games against the United States and Mexico next month. Against France, Germany was coached by a three-person caretaker team including sporting director Rudi Völler. He was Germany's coach when it reached the 2002 World Cup final but hadn't taken charge of any game for 18 years. France had not conceded a goal in five games since losing the World Cup final to Argentina last year, but Germany scored in just the fourth minute. Thomas Müller, brought back to the squad by Flick last week for the first time this year, controlled Benjamin Henrichs' cross and hammered the ball past goalkeeper Mike Maignan. France could have had a penalty when Antonio Rüdiger appeared to shove Randal Kolo Muani to the ground in the penalty area in the 20th, but the referee opted not to give it. Aurelien Tchouameni had chances to score with two first-half headers at corners and a low shot in the 57th which was saved. Sané made it 2-0 on a swift counter in the 87th but almost immediately gave away a penalty for a foul on Eduardo Camavinga. Antoine Griezmann converted the spot-kick. On a night when Germany far surpassed expectations, there was concern over its captain, Barcelona midfielder Ilkay Gündogan, who went off injured in the 25th after landing heavily on his back following an aerial challenge.

'Will Always Support Decisions Of Putin': North Korea's Kim Meets Russian President Amid West's Concerns,"North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un on Wednesday said that Pyongyang supports all decisions by Moscow as he met the Russian President Vladimir Putin at a cosmodrome in Russia's far east Amur region. ""Russia has risen to a sacred fight to protect its sovereignty and security against the hegemonic forces,"" Kim told Putin, as per a BBC report. ""North Korea supports all Putin's decisions,"" he added. As per several media reports, Kim reached Russia on Tuesday on his private train amid concerns by the West of an arms deal to support Russia in its invasion of Ukraine. On being asked whether the two leaders would talk about obtaining arms supplies from the North to replenish Moscow's dwindling stock of weapons and ammunition, Putin said they would discuss ""all issues"", reported Reuters. Kim-Putin Meet ""I am glad to see you,"" Putin said as he welcomed Kim at Vostochny Cosmodrome a modern space launch facility in the Amur region of Russia's Far East. ""This is our new cosmodrome."" As the two leaders shook hands for around 40 seconds, Kim, through a translator, thanked Putin for the invitation and for the warmth of his reception, the Reuters report added. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); Pictures released by Russian media earlier showed Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korea's leader, was also accompanying her brother in his visit. Both the delegations include top diplomats and military commanders, according to the BBC report. Kim's entourage includes commander of the Korean People's Army Ri Pyong Chol, his number two, Pak Jong Chon, and Jo Chun Ryong, the director of North Korea's Munitions Industry Department. Putin, who travelled a fair distance from Moscow was accompanied by Russia's defence minister Sergei Shoigu and foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. US, Allies Keeping Close Watch The meeting between the leaders of the two nations, which have become increasingly isolated internationally, is being closely watched by Washington and allies who suspect that the two countries can seal a deal to trade arms and defence technologies as stock of arms and ammunition dwindle for Russia in its invasion in Ukraine. Officials from US and South Korea have expressed concerns that Kim could provide weapons to Russia while such intentions were denied by Moscow and Pyongyang, the Reuters report stated.",world
'An Outstanding Person': Russia's Putin Comes Out In Praise For Elon Musk Days After He Declines Ukraine Starlink Request,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed admiration for tech magnate Elon Musk, commending his contributions to the space transportation sector through his company, SpaceX. This acknowledgement from Putin follows recent revelations made by Musk, in which he disclosed declining a Ukrainian appeal last year to activate his Starlink satellite communication network in the Russian-annexed Crimean port city of Sevastopol, citing concerns about involvement in a significant military conflict. During an economic forum in Russia's Far East, as reported by Al Jazeera, Putin refrained from addressing the Starlink controversy directly but spoke highly of Musk's accomplishments in rocket launches through SpaceX. Putin stated, ""As far as private business and Elon Musk is concerned… he is undoubtedly an outstanding person. This must be recognised, and I think it is recognised all over the world. He is an active and talented businessman and he is succeeding a lot, including with the support of the American state."" Furthermore, Putin offered his defence of former US President Donald Trump, emphasising the multiple legal cases Trump is currently facing. According to Putin, these charges reveal flaws within the American political system, characterising them as ""persecution of a political rival for political motives."" Trump confronts various criminal cases in the United States, including federal charges in Washington, DC, related to alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, state charges in Georgia for election interference, and federal charges in Florida for the alleged mishandling of classified documents following his White House departure. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); Earlier this month, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, known for his hawkish stance on Ukraine and potential conflicts with the West, also praised Musk's actions concerning Starlink, Crimea, and Ukraine's military forces on Musk's social media platform, previously known as Twitter. Medvedev hailed Musk as ""the last rational mind in North America."" While Ukrainian officials have criticised Musk's decision to safeguard the Russian fleet from potential attacks, US Democratic Party Senator Elizabeth Warren has called for a congressional investigation into Musk's actions. Warren remarked, ""The US Congress should examine whether we possess adequate mechanisms to ensure that foreign policy is conducted by the government and not by a single billionaire,"" according to Bloomberg news agency. SpaceX, under Musk's leadership, secured a contract from the US Department of Defense to provide Starlink satellite communication services to Ukraine. Russia, having annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, bases its Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol, employing it to impose blockades on Ukrainian ports since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The Russian fleet has also launched cruise missiles at Ukrainian civilian targets, prompting retaliatory actions from Kyiv, including the use of maritime drones. Much appreciated, Walter. The onus is meaningfully different if I refused to act upon a request from Ukraine vs. made a deliberate change to Starlink to thwart Ukraine. At no point did I or anyone at SpaceX promise coverage over Crimea. Moreover, our terms of service clearly… https://t.co/jmNtScM5LY — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 9, 2023 Musk, in a recent post, disclosed his refusal to comply with Ukraine's emergency request to activate Starlink to Sevastopol, emphasising that such an action would have been tantamount to explicit complicity in a major act of war and escalation of the conflict.",world
Planning an international trip? How 20% TCS from next month will impact your foreign travel plans,"If you are planning an international trip in October, then be ready to loosen your purse strings more. This is because the new rule levying 20% tax collected at source (TCS) will kick in from 1 October 2023. This applies not only to foreign trips but to every transaction you make abroad via whatever method. What is tax collected at source (TCS)? The tax collected at the source is implemented by the government to collect taxes directly from the seller at the source of certain transactions. How will 20% from next month impact your travel Commencing from October 1, 2023, there will be a significant alteration in TCS regulations, witnessing a steep rise from the existing 5% to an elevated 20%. This results in a 15% escalation in expenses for individuals seeking international travel packages Rikant Pittie, Co-founder, EaseMyTrip said that in light of these changes, travelers are advised to: 1) Ensure that the cost of their travel package does not exceed the 7 Lakh threshold per individual. 2) We highly recommend meticulous and strategic trip planning to maximize budget efficiency. “For packages valued at or under 7 lakh per financial year per individual, the 5% TCS rate will remain applicable. This typically encompasses the costs associated with an annual overseas leisure tour,"" he added. What does 20% TCS rule mean? Any payments done in the foreign land exceeding 7 lakh a year through international credit and debit cards will be subject to TCS levy at the rate of 20 per cent effective 1 October 2023. Can taxpayers claim ‘20% TCS’ back? Yes, taxpayers can claim a TCS refund in your Income Tax Return. “Individuals will see a higher bill on their cards, potentially blocking money for several months until a return is filed/refund is claimed and tax already collected is adjusted. Taxpayers may now have to keep track of these TCS entries in their Form 26AS,"" said Archit Gupta, Founder, and CEO, Clear. The Union Budget 2023-24 had hiked TCS rates to 20%, from 5% currently, on overseas tour packages and funds remitted under LRS (other than for education and medical purposes).",business

"A Crimean Sevastopol shipyard on fire after Ukrainian attack with two ships damaged, 24 people injured","“The Sevastopol Shipyard in Russian-annexed Crimea was on fire early Wednesday (September 13) after a Ukrainian attack with two ships that were being repaired there sustaining damage and 24 people injured,” Russian authorities reported. The attack on the shipyard appeared to be one of the biggest in recent weeks, even though the Crimean peninsula, annexed from Ukraine by Russia in 2014, has been a frequent target in the 18-month old war. Russian shelling kills two people in east Ukraine Russia's Defence Ministry said Ukraine launched 10 cruise missiles at the shipyard and three sea drones at Russian ships in the Black Sea . Seven missiles were shot down and all the sea drones have been destroyed, the military said, but some of the missiles damaged two ships that were being repaired in the shipyard. There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian officials, who almost never acknowledge Kyiv's responsibility for attacks on Crimea or Russian regions that have become regular in recent months. Mikhail Razvozhayev, Moscow-appointed governor of the port city of Sevastopol on the Crimean peninsula, said on Telegram on Wednesday that 24 people were injured in the fire. He posted a photo of the fire with smoke billowing over it. The Sevastopol Shipyard is of strategic importance to Russia as vessels in its Black Sea fleet are being repaired there.",world
"iPhone 15 Pro Max vs. iPhone 14 Pro Max -- Specs, price, and features, compared","Affiliate Disclosure If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy . Apple A-Z » iPhone » iPhone 15 » Vs iPhone 15 Pro Max vs. iPhone 14 Pro Max — Specs, price, and features, compared Malcolm Owen | Sep 12, 2023 iPhone 15 Pro Max (left), iPhone 14 Pro Max (right) 12 Facebook Twitter Reddit The 2023 update to Apple's iPhone range has made a bit of a departure from the norm, with Apple including a feature specific to the iPhone 15 Pro Max that the others do not have. The enhanced zoom capability will make the model even more attractive to photographers and videographers. While Apple does usually make changes to its Pro lineup each year, this serves to be a bigger change than usual. Especially when you consider it's just for this model. Here's how it stands when measured against the 2022 iteration, the iPhone 14 Pro Max . iPhone 15 Pro Max vs. iPhone 14 Pro Max — Specifications Specifications iPhone 14 Pro Max iPhone 15 Pro Max Price (starting) $1,099 Check prices $1,199 Dimensions (inches) 6.33 x 3.05 x 0.31 6.29 x 3.02 x 0.32 Weight (ounces) 8.47 7.81 Processor A16 Bionic A17 Pro Storage 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB 256GB, 512GB, 1TB Display type 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR, ProMotion, always-on display 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR, ProMotion, always-on display Resolution 2,796 x 1,290 at 460 ppi 2,796 x 1,290 at 460 ppi True Tone Yes Yes Biometrics Face ID Face ID Connectivity 5G (Sub-6GHz and mmWave) Gigabit-class LTE Wi-Fi 6 Bluetooth 5.3 Ultra Wideband Emergency SOS via Satellite Roadside Assistance via Satellite Lightning 5G (Sub-6GHz and mmWave) Gigabit-class LTE Wi-Fi 6E Bluetooth 5.3 Ultra Wideband Emergency SOS via Satellite Roadside Assistance via Satellite USB-C Rear Cameras 48MP Wide 12MP Ultra Wide 12MP Telephoto with 3x optical zoom 48MP Wide 12MP Ultra Wide 12MP Telephoto with 5x optical zoom Video 4K 60fps, 4K 60fps HDR with Dolby Vision, 1080p 240fps Slo-Mo ProRes 4K 30fps, Cinematic Mode, Action Mode 4K 60fps, 4K 60fps HDR with Dolby Vision, 1080p 240fps Slo-Mo ProRes 4K 60fps with external recording, Cinematic Mode, Action Mode Front Camera 12MP TrueDepth with Autofocus 12MP TrueDepth with Autofocus Battery Size (Video playback time) Up to 29 hours Up to 29 hours Colors Space Black, Gold, Silver, Deep Purple Black Titanium, White Titanium, Blue Titanium, Natural Titanium #table-0 td:nth-of-type(1):before{ content: ""Specifications "" }#table-0 td:nth-of-type(2):before{ content: ""iPhone 14 Pro Max "" }#table-0 td:nth-of-type(3):before{ content: ""iPhone 15 Pro Max "" } iPhone 15 Pro Max vs iPhone 14 Pro Max - Physical Dimensions The iPhone 14 Pro Max was the largest iPhone Apple made in 2022, with a length of 6.33 inches and a width of 3.05 inches giving it a sizable footprint. Even so, it was still fairly thin at 0.31 inches. At 6.29 inches long and 3.02 inches wide, the iPhone 15 Pro is a tiny bit shorter than its predecessor, but it's slightly thicker at 0.32 inches. At 8.47 ounces, the iPhone 14 Pro Max tipped the scales in the range, simply because of its size. The iPhone 15 Pro Max is a lot lighter at 7.81 ounces. Just as with the iPhone 14 Pro, the Pro Max reuses Apple's standard iPhone aesthetic of flat edges and rounded corners. It continued its pattern of using a stainless steel enclosure paired with a glass back and a front glass panel sporting a Ceramic Shield protective layer. iPhone 15 Pro Max vs iPhone 14 Pro Max — rear and side profiles Where the 2023 edition differs is that Apple's going down the titanium route. Using Grade 5 titanium for a strong frame and a striking appearance, the change allowed Apple to save some weight as well as reduce the size without sacrificing the screen, resulting in thinner bezels. Apple has also made a change to the switch on the side, removing the Ring/Silent toggle in favor of an Action button . This can be used to silence the iPhone's ringer, but it can be set to perform many different actions too. iPhone 15 Pro Max vs iPhone 14 Pro Max - Displays The iPhone 14 Pro Max has a 6.7-inch all-screen OLED display, namely Apple's Super Retina XDR display. At 2,796 by 1,290 pixels, the screen has a pixel density of 460 pixels per inch. For the iPhone 15 Pro Max, the specifications are effectively identical, with the same size and resolution as the year-ago model. The OLED screen in both devices has a contrast ratio of 2 million to one, as well as a brightness that has a typical maximum of 1,000 nits, 1,600 nits at a peak for HDR content, or up to 2,000 nits of peak brightness when you're outdoors. Apple used an always-on screen for the iPhone 14 Pro Max, which displays a standby screen when the device is sleeping so that users can see some important information at a glance without fully waking it. ProMotion support was also included, offering adaptive refresh rates that go up to 120Hz, depending on the type of content viewed on the screen. All of these return in the iPhone 15 Pro Max. At the top of the iPhone 14 Pro Max's screen was the Dynamic Island, the replacement for the notch that added more interactive UI elements. With a year on the clock, it's back once again, and will benefit from iOS 17's tweaks. Wide Color (P3) support, True Tone, HDR support, and a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating are also included in the iPhone 14 Pro Max and iPhone 15 Pro Max displays. iPhone 15 Pro Max vs iPhone 14 Pro Max - Cameras On the back of the iPhone 14 Pro Max are three cameras, including a 48-megapixel Main camera with an f/1.78 aperture, a second-gen sensor-shift optical image stabilization system and a seven-element lens. A 12-megapixel Ultra-Wide camera is next with an f/2.2 aperture six-element lens, and a 120-degree field of view. The third of the trio is the 12MP 3x Telephoto, complete with an f/2.8 aperture, optical image stabilization, and a six-element lens. For the iPhone 14 Pro Max's Main camera, the high resolution allowed Apple to crop the image to create a virtual 12MP 2x Telephoto camera. Overall, the iPhone 14 Pro has a 2x optical zoom out and a 3x optical zoom in, with digital zoom reaching up to 15x. Apple's updated iPhone 15 Pro Max camera system The iPhone 15 Pro Max also uses three cameras, with a 48MP Main heading up the list with an f/1.78 aperture and second-gen sensor shift. That Main camera gains a new 24MP default image, and allows users to switch between effective focal lengths of 24mm, 28mm, and 35mm. The Ultra Wide is a 12-megapixel version with an f/2.2 aperture once again, complete with a 120-degree field of view. The 12MP Telephoto camera is an outlier, as it uses a whole new tetraprism design to enable a 5x optical zoom. There's also a 3D sensor-shift optical image stabilization and autofocus at play for the camera, which also has an f/2.8 aperture. The changes enable the digital zoom to reach up to 25x, dwarfing not only the iPhone 14 Pro Max's 15x, but also the 15x of its non-Pro counterpart. All of the cameras have 100% Focus Pixel coverage, to assist with focusing on subjects. The Pro line also benefits from the inclusion of a LiDAR sensor, which assists with focusing and can greatly improve night shot images. Apple's Photonic Engine and Deep Fusion computational photography helps improve shots taken with the rear cameras. There's also support for Portrait Mode with six-effect Portrait Lighting, Night Mode, Smart HDR 4 and 5 depending on device vintage, and other usual functions. To video, and the iPhone 14 Pro Max can handle 4K 60fps Dolby Vision HDR, 4K 30fps in Cinematic mode, and 2.8K 60fps Action mode. ProRes video at up to 4K 30fps, and 1080p 240fps Slo-Mo also available. Macro Photography, Cinematic video stabilization, Audio Zoom, and stereo recording round out the video list. The figures don't change that much for the iPhone 15 Pro Max, as it too can handle 4K 60fps Dolby Vision HDR, 4K HDR Cinematic Mode at 60fps, and 2.8K 60fps Action Mode. 1080P 240fps Slo-mo is also the same. This time around, Apple is making more of a play to videographers, with ProRes video at up to 4K 60fps with external recording support. This refers to attaching an external drive to the iPhone, and recording video straight to it. This was't possible under the iPhone 14 Pro Max, as it used Lightning which has a slow data rate of 480Mbps. With the use of USB-C, the iPhone 15 Pro Max can transfer data along the cable 20 times faster, which is more than enough to enable external drive recording. Even better for video production, Apple includes log video recording, as well as support for the Academy Color Encoding System. Around the front, the iPhone 14 Pro Max's TrueDepth camera at the front has a 12-megapixel sensor and an f/1.9 aperture, Focus Pixels, and a six-element lens. It has Portrait Mode and Portrait Lighting effects, 4K60fps video, Cinematic Mode 4K HDR at 30fps, Dolby Vision at 4K60fps, and Pro-Res to 4K30fps. There's no change for the iPhone 15 Pro Max here, with the exception of enabling externally recorded 4K ProRes footage at 60fps, log video, and the Academy Color Encoding System. The TrueDepth camera's depth-mapping system, which persists into 2023, further helps with security, namely powering Face ID, and is usable for applications such as Animoji and Memoji. iPhone 15 Pro Max vs iPhone 14 Pro Max - Processing Performance Every year, Apple moves the Pro models to the next chip in its A-series range. For 2023, that means a change to the A17 Bionic for the iPhone 15 Pro Max, up from the A16 Bionic of the iPhone 14 Pro Max. The A16 Bionic has a six-core CPU with two performance cores and four efficiency cores, along with a five-core GPU and a 16-core Neural Engine. Apple originally promoted the A16 as being ""up to 40 percent faster than the competition,"" that the GPU has 50% more memory bandwidth, and the Neural Engine was capable of nearly 17 trillion operations per second. iPhone 15 Pro Max vs iPhone 14 Pro Max: Less of a bezel for the iPhone 15 Pro Max Apple is moving on to the A17 for the iPhone 15 Pro Max, except it's also moving another element too: the name. Now, the chip is known as the A17 Pro, not the Bionic. The A17 Pro is the first 3-nanometer mobile chip, with it including the same six-core CPU setup as the A16. Except it happens to be 10% faster thanks to microarchitectural and design improvements. The 6-core GPU is also new, 20% faster than the A16, and even includes hardware-accelerated ray tracing . An onboard AV1 decoder will help improve video streaming for those late-night Netflix sessions. Apple also says that the Neural Engine is also twice as fast as before. For the moment, we can only go on what Apple has claimed about the new chip, so we can't really compare performance using benchmarks yet, but that should change in the next few weeks. iPhone 15 Pro Max vs iPhone 14 Pro Max - Connectivity The iPhone 14 Pro Max, like the rest in the range, has 5G connectivity that supports both sub-6GHz and mmWave bands. In black spots without cellular communications, there's the then-new Emergency SOS via Satellite feature that used satellites to send messages to get assistance. The iPhone 14 Pro Max sports Wi-Fi 6 for local networking, Bluetooth 5.3 for accessories, Ultra Wideband, and NFC for services like Apple Pay. The iPhone 15 Pro Max differs by having Wi-Fi 6E support, a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip that enables more location features, and explicit Thread support. The physical connectivity of the iPhone 14 Pro Max consists of a Lightning port in the base, used for both data transfers and charging. For 2023, as part of Apple's shift away from Lightning, it has finally moved the iPhone 15 Pro Max over to USB-C . This change has a number of implications for charging, but more importantly it changes data transfer speeds. Rather than 480Mbps transfer speeds, USB-C in the Pro models works at 10Gbps, which will make it quicker to move files on and off the iPhone. This is very useful for videographers who shoot with an iPhone but need to get hefty ProRes video off their devices in a timely fashion. Apple says that it is also possible to record video directly to an external drive using the connection, too, but how well this will work in practice remains to be seen. iPhone 15 Pro Max vs iPhone 14 Pro Max - Power and Battery According to Apple, the iPhone 14 Pro Max's battery life allows up to 29 hours of video playback for locally stored footage, or up to 25 hours of streamed video playback. For audio, you can get up to 95 hours of playback. The iPhone 15 Pro Max is claimed to run for exactly the same periods of time. At present, it's not clear if the battery is the same, or if the iPhone 15 Pro Max draws more power from a battery with more capacity than the iPhone 14 Pro Max. The lithium-ion battery in both devices can be recharged by a physical cable or using wireless charging, over Qi or MagSafe. Wireless charging is usually slower than wired, as Qi works at up to 7.5W under Apple-imposed limits, and MagSafe up to 15W. Fast charging is handled over a wired connection. For both the iPhone 14 Pro Max and iPhone 15 Pro Max, you can get to a 50% charge using the Lightning port in about 35 minutes, if you're using a 20W or higher charging adapter. iPhone 15 Pro Max vs iPhone 14 Pro Max - Other Features The iPhone 14 Pro Max is rated at IP68 for water and dust resistance, which the iPhone 14 Pro Max also meets. For water, this means it can survive at a maximum depth of 6 meters (19.7 feet) for up to half an hour. Apple introduced Crash Detection in the iPhone 14 Pro, which uses a collection of sensors on the iPhone to determine if there has been a significant impact, such as a car accident. Once an incident is detected, the iPhone will automatically call the emergency services for help unless the device owner or a passenger stops the countdown. Now, Apple has introduced Roadside Assistance via Satellite, which is the same feature but aimed at getting assistance for your broken-down vehicle in a cellular deadzone. This feature isn't limited to the iPhone 15 Pro Max, as it will also be available on the iPhone 14 Pro Max too. iPhone 15 Pro Max vs iPhone 14 Pro Max - Capacity, Color, and Pricing At launch, the iPhone 14 Pro Max cost $1,099 for the 128GB model, 256GB cost $1,199, the 512GB capacity was $1,399, and 1TB was available for $1,599. The iPhone 14 Pro was sold in four colors: Space Black, Gold, Silver, and Deep Purple. iPhone 15 Pro Max vs iPhone 14 Pro Max: The iPhone 15 Pro Max color range The iPhone 15 Pro Max has the same pricing, except that it eliminates the 128GB capacity, leaving the 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB options. It's available in four colors: Black Titanium, White Titanium, Blue Titanium, and Natural Titanium. iPhone 15 Pro Max vs iPhone 14 Pro Max - What to Buy The Pro iPhone line has always benefited from being at the forefront of Apple's technological advances. You'd pay a premium, but you will know that you're getting the best smartphone the company produces. Now, not only do you have to get a Pro model, you also have to get the biggest if you want the best. The main updates affecting all iPhone 15 Pro models are good on their own, such as the switch to USB-C from Lightning and the performance and graphical improvements brought along by the A17 Pro chip. Adding in titanium for a more durable device is also a great move by Apple. When you add in the camera change for extra optical zoom on the iPhone 15 Pro Max, you realize this model is a videographer's dream smartphone. You have that expansive zoom, Log recording support, and fast USB-C, with that latter point solving the issue of getting footage quickly off the iPhone and enabling external recording too. iPhone 15 Pro Max vs iPhone 14 Pro Max: The cameras are the main draw, but USB-C is nice too... For the average user, the iPhone 15 Pro Max isn't a massive upgrade worth considering if they already own an iPhone 14 Pro Max. Keen photographers, video producers, and creatives of many different types will see the camera and USB-C changes, and suddenly the upgrade becomes more viable. Add in that it's the same cost on a capacity basis as the iPhone 14 Pro Max at its year-ago launch, and the upgrades seem like a bargain. Owners of earlier iPhones wanting to make a big jump will find themselves happy with their purchase. Anyone involved in the visual arts will be ecstatic.

Iran identifies 5 prisoners it wants from US in swap for Iranian-Americans,"Listen to Story Iran on Tuesday identified the five prisoners it hopes to see freed in the United States in exchange for five Iranian-Americans now held in Tehran and billions in assets once held by South Korea. The acknowledgment by the Iranian mission to the United Nations in New York comes as the Biden administration has issued a blanket waiver for international banks to transfer $6 billion in frozen Iranian money from South Korea to Qatar without fear of U.S. sanctions. The moves by both Tehran and Washington appear to signal the prisoner swap is progressing as the money once held in South Korean won is converted into euros and moved to Qatar, where Iran will be able to use it for humanitarian purposes. In a statement to The Associated Press, Ali Karimi Magham, a spokesman for the Iranian mission, confirmed the list of prisoners that Tehran wants released. The five sought by the Iranians are: — Kaveh Lotfolah Afrasiabi, an Iranian charged in 2021 with allegedly failing to register as a foreign agent on Iran’s behalf while lobbying U.S. officials on issues like nuclear policy; — Mehrdad Ansari, an Iranian sentenced to 63 months in prison in 2021 for obtaining equipment that could be used in missiles, electronic warfare, nuclear weapons and other military gear; — Amin Hasanzadeh, an Iranian and permanent resident of the United States whom prosecutors charged in 2019 with allegedly stealing engineering plans from his employer to send to Iran; — Reza Sarhangpour Kafrani, an Iranian charged in 2021 over allegedly unlawfully exporting laboratory equipment to Iran; and — Kambiz Attar Kashani, an Iranian-American sentenced in February to 30 months in prison for purchasing “sophisticated, top-tier U.S. electronic equipment and software” through front companies in the United Arab Emirates. The U.S. State Department declined to comment, citing “the sensitivity of this ongoing process.” The news website Al-Monitor, relying on a statement from the Iranian mission, first reported the Iranians’ identities on Monday. On the U.S. side, Washington seeks the release of Siamak Namazi, who was detained in Iran in 2015 and later sentenced to 10 years in prison on internationally criticized spying charges; Emad Sharghi, a venture capitalist sentenced to 10 years; and Morad Tahbaz, a British-American conservationist of Iranian descent who was arrested in 2018 and also received a 10-year sentence. The fourth and fifth prisoners were not identified. All five are under house arrest at a hotel in Tehran. U.S. Republicans have criticized the possibility of an exchange, which is under discussion amid heightened tensions between Iran and the West over its nuclear program, as well as a series of ship seizures and attacks attributed to Tehran. The Pentagon is considering a plan to put U.S. troops on board commercial ships in the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of all oil shipments pass moving out of the Persian Gulf. A major deployment of U.S. sailors and Marines, alongside F-35s, F-16s and other military aircraft, is also underway in the region.

"Boston man walks into probe office, confesses to killing, raping woman in 1979","Listen to Story Authorities in Massachusetts on Monday solved a 44-year-old murder case after an elderly man confessed to killing and then raping a woman in Boston back in 1979. The man was identified as John Michael Irmer. According to a news release from the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office in Boston, Irmer was charged with killing 24-year-old Susan Marcia Rose on October 30, 1979. In his confession to the police, Irmer said he had met Rose at a Boston skating rink around Halloween in 1979. He said they both then walked into 285 Beacon Street (a building under renovation at the time), where he hammered her to death. Irmer told police he then raped the woman. Following Irmer's confessions, authorities said they confirmed Rose, who had red hair, was found murdered on Beacon Street. Her cause of death was ruled to be multiple blunt injuries to the head with fractures of the skull and lacerations of the brain. Investigators were also able to match a DNA sample from Irmer with samples collected from the murder scene. Irmer also confessed to committing another murder in California, for which he had served nearly 30 years in prison. The news release in the case stated another man was tried and found not guilty of Rose’s murder in 1981. Meanwhile, Irmer was taken into custody and was held without bail.",world
"China says it has not banned purchase, use of iPhones, foreign phone brands","China has not issued a ban on the purchase and use of foreign phone brands, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Wednesday, in response to media reports that said some government agencies and firms had told staff to stop using Apple's iPhones at work . ""China has not issued laws, regulations or policy documents that prohibit the purchase and use of foreign brand phones such as Apple's,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told a regular press briefing when asked about the reports. ""But recently we did notice a lot of media exposure of security incidents related to Apple's phones. The Chinese government attaches great importance to information and cyber security and treats both domestic and foreign companies as equals,"" she added. Reuters recently reported that China had widened existing curbs on the use of iPhones by state employees, telling staff at some central government agencies to stop using their Apple mobiles at work. The supposed ban coincides with rising tensions between Beijing and Washington, and signals growing challenges for Apple, which relies heavily on China for revenue growth and manufacturing. Ms. Mao said China hoped all mobile phone companies would strictly abide its laws and regulations, as well as ""strengthen information security management"". China has increasingly emphasised using locally-made tech products, as technology has become a major national security issue for Beijing and Washington.",world
Australia High Court rules Qantas Airways illegally fired workers in pandemic,"Listen to Story Australia's top court on Thursday ruled Qantas Airways broke the law by sacking 1,700 ground staff and replacing them with contractors early in the Covid-19 pandemic, reinvigorating public criticism of a company already facing multiple scandals. The High Court of Australia said Qantas had commercial reasons for its actions in 2020 - the height of pandemic-driven border closures - but broke industrial law because it ""sought to thwart"" the unionised employees' rights to engage in industrial action and collectively bargain. The ruling builds on a sense of public fury towards the flagship carrier that culminated in the early retirement of its long-serving CEO this month following an antitrust lawsuit accusing the airline of selling tickets to thousands of flights after they were cancelled. The company has also been accused of pressuring the federal government, successfully, to deny a Qatar Airways request to sell more flights to Australia, removing competition that might have lowered fares. Qantas has declined to comment on its lobbying. Its shares have fallen nearly 17% since July 24 amid intense scrutiny of its reputation. The lower-ranking Federal Court in 2021 found Qantas broke the law by outsourcing the ground handling jobs, but the airline appealed the ruling in the High Court which upheld the decision on Thursday. The matter now returns to the Federal Court which will decide penalties and compensation for affected employees. ""These workers have been put through hell,"" said Michael Kaine, secretary of the Transport Workers Union (TWU) which brought the lawsuit. ""Their families have been put through hell, their lives have been dislocated, some of them forever,"" he added, speaking to journalists. Qantas must return to the Federal Court and ""do everything you can to expedite compensation for the workers so that they can get some justice and solace for themselves and their families,"" Kaine said. Qantas said in a statement that it accepted the High Court decision and noted the Federal Court had already ruled out forcing the company to reinstate the workers. It said it had already made an unspecified provision in its accounts for penalties and compensation for affected employees after the Federal Court decision. ""As we have said from the beginning, we deeply regret the personal impact the outsourcing decision had on all those affected and we sincerely apologise for that,"" the airline's statement said. Qantas shares were down 0.4% in morning trading, less than the broader market (.AXJO) decline of 0.8%. When it outsourced the baggage handling roles, the airline said it would save an estimated A$100 million ($64.15 million) a year in operating costs as well as A$100 million of investment in equipment over five years. It also allowed Qantas to avoid potential future strikes by the TWU. The company posted a record annual profit last month as strong demand for international travel pushed up fares.",world
North Korea fires 2 ballistic missiles toward its eastern seas,"North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles toward its eastern seas Wednesday, its neighbors said. The launch came as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was traveling in Russia for a meeting with President Vladimir Putin while there are international concerns about a potential arms deal that could fuel Moscow’s war efforts in Ukraine. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected the missiles being fired 10 minutes apart from an area in Sunan, the site of Pyongyang’s international airport, and that the weapons flew cross-country toward the country’s eastern seas. It didn’t immediately say how far the weapons flew. On September 17, a flag hoisting ceremony will precede the special Parliament session scheduled for September 18 to 22. The event aligns with both Vishwakarma Puja and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday.

"Libyan city Derna counts toll of huge flood; 10,000 missing","Libya's eastern city of Derna was counting the death toll on September 13 with 2,300 people confirmed killed in devastating flash floods unleashed by Storm Daniel and the Red Cross warning that 10,000 are missing. Two river dams burst after the storm hit on Sunday afternoon, releasing an enormous surge of water that tore through the Mediterranean coastal city, sweeping away buildings and the people inside them. By late Tuesday, the confirmed death toll from emergency services in the politically fractured North African country was at least 2,300, although some officials were quoted as giving figures more than twice as high. Another 10,000 people were still missing, said Tamer Ramadan of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. ""The death toll is huge and might reach thousands,"" Mr. Ramadan said. ""We don't have a definite number right now,"" he said on Tuesday, stressing though that the organisation had independent sources saying ""the number of missing people is hitting 10,000 persons so far"". Media reports quoted a spokesman for the Interior Ministry of Libya's eastern-based government as saying ""more than 5,200"" people had died in Derna. The city of Derna, a 300 km (190 mile) drive east of Benghazi, is ringed by hills and bisected by what is normally a dry riverbed in summer, but which became a raging torrent of mud-brown water that also swept away several major bridges. Derna was home to about 1,00,000 people, and many of its multi-storey buildings on the banks of the riverbed collapsed, with people, their homes and cars vanishing in the raging waters. With global concern about the disaster spreading, several nations offered urgent aid and rescue teams to help the war-scarred country that has been overwhelmed by what one UN official called ""a calamity of epic proportions"". Elsewhere in eastern Libya, aid group the Norwegian Refugee Council said on Tuesday that ""entire villages have been overwhelmed by the floods and the death toll continues to rise"". ""Communities across Libya have endured years of conflict, poverty and displacement. The latest disaster will exacerbate the situation for these people. Hospitals and shelters will be overstretched."" Oil-rich Libya is still recovering from years of war and chaos that followed the 2011 NATO-backed popular uprising which toppled and killed long-time dictator Moamer Kadhafi. The country is divided between two rival governments — the UN-brokered, internationally recognised administration based in Tripoli, and a separate administration in the disaster-hit east. Rescue teams from Turkey have arrived in eastern Libya, according to authorities. The United Nations and several countries offered to send aid, among them Algeria, Egypt, France, Italy, Qatar and Tunisia. France is sending a field hospital and around 50 military and civilian personnel able to treat 500 people a day, Paris said on Tuesday.",world

While Kim was out of the country, North Korea fired two ballistic missiles on Wednesday, the South Korean military said, the latest in a string of sanctions-busting tests. Kim thanked Putin for inviting him to visit, despite the Russian leader's ""busy schedule"", having earlier stressed the trip -- his first post-pandemic foreign travel -- showed North Korea was ""prioritising the strategic importance"" of its Russia ties.

Sunil Chhetri to lead India's Asian Games squad in China,"Listen to Story India announced their Asian Games football squad on Wednesday, 13 September. The All India Football Federation named a 15-member squad for the continental tournament which is going to be led by India captain Sunil Chhetri later in the month of September and October in Hangzhou, China. While announcing the squad, the AIFF expressed its thanks to clubs in the Indian Super League for coordinating with the national body for the release of players in the Asian Games. The ISL and the I League clubs were in no compulsion to send their players to the tournament as it would have clashed with the upcoming domestic season in Indian football. AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey via an official statement said that it was going to be a hectic season for Indian football. India have had a busy schedule with SAFF Cup, Intercontinental Cup, Kings Cup and Tri-Nation series and it is going to be more complicated for the players and their teams in case the team goes the distance in the tournament. “It has been a hectic time for Indian football season this time. We have a tight schedule within a short period of time that was not easy to manage,"" Chaubey said in the statement. “There have been too many things happening, both at the domestic and the international level, involving India’s National Teams, as well as the ISL clubs. While the Senior National Men’s Team successfully completed playing a series of matches, they are also awaiting to play the Asian Games, followed by Merdeka Cup, World Cup Qualifiers, and the AFC Asian Cup,” he further added. “We must remember that there are general elections coming, and to avoid the adverse weather conditions in certain parts of the country, we had to adjust the schedule, and shorten the domestic calendar to an extent so that these things don’t hamper the quality of the games and put unnecessary pressure on the players,"" the AIFF statement said quoting Chaubey. “There were situations which were unavoidable and demanded a great balancing act. It was never easy, but at the same time, I must reach out to FSDL and the clubs, thanking them for making it possible. The Indian National Team are going to the Asian Games after a nine-year gap, and it has become possible because of the active support the Indian Football received from the Government of India, especially the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports,” said the AIFF President. He once again thanked the Government of India and the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports for their support to Indian football and utmost cooperation,"" he further added. It needs to be noted that the Indian Olympic Association initially had not allowed the Indian team to participate in the Asian Games. But after the AIFF and in particular Igor Stimac persisted with their requests, the Sports Ministry overruled the IOA's decision and allowed the team to participate in the tournament.

Michael Gove’s local council warns of bankruptcy risk after failed Tory investments,"Michael Gove’s local council is warning that it faces effective bankruptcy within two years after racking up millions of pounds in debt for failed property investments overseen by its former Conservative administration. Surrey Heath borough council is in the parliamentary constituency of Gove, who as levelling up secretary is the cabinet minister in charge of local government. The tiny Surrey local authority – where the Liberal Democrats seized power in May after almost half a century of Conservative control – said its finances were under “severe pressure” as it struggles with debts worth £165m, while warning that high inflation and rising debt interest payments could leave it in “effective bankruptcy”. “Clearly he [Gove] and his colleagues have been asleep at the wheel for a long time,” said Shaun Macdonald, the council’s new Lib Dem leader. “You’ve ended up with this cosy Conservative club in places like Surrey, where the parish, borough, county, and national government representatives are the same people. You really have to question who’s overseeing these things. “It feels as if people are going to the casino and putting it all on black.” Council debt table The comments come amid an escalating crisis for town halls across the country after years of budget cuts and local mismanagement, as growing numbers of English councils warn that huge debt piles are leading them to the brink of financial meltdown. Birmingham city council, the largest local authority in Europe, became the latest to declare that it was in effect bankrupt last week, issuing a section 114 notice to signal that it does not have the resources to balance its budget. Although Rishi Sunak has sought to capitalise on the meltdown at the Labour-run council as a sign that Keir Starmer’s party would “bankrupt Britain”, dozens of other local authorities from across the political divide are in financial distress. Seven local authorities in Surrey, largely controlled by Tory or Lib Dem administrations, were included on a list of 20 councils with the highest levels of debt in England relative to their size this week by the rating agency Moody’s. It warned that more were likely to go bankrupt after a string of high-profile failures at Woking , Croydon , Thurrock and Slough . Highlighting a financial crisis in Gove’s constituency, Macdonald said Surrey Heath’s debts would take decades to pay off, while rising borrowing costs, high inflation, and soaring demand for services had left its finances on an unsustainable trajectory. In 2016, the then Tory council borrowed to invest £113m in a shopping centre complex and House of Fraser department store in the town of Camberley. However, the properties are now valued at £33m – a loss of £79m. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He warned that without central government support, the council could be forced to make cuts to discretionary services – such as provision of swimming pools and grants to voluntary organisations – in a similar package of localised austerity to neighbouring Woking . “It’s not just here, it’s other places. The deals have gone sour – and the taxpayer locally is left to foot the bill,” he said. Gove was warned in writing about Surrey Heath’s financial woes earlier this year by its former Tory leadership. The council wrote to the secretary of state asking him to intervene to help it sack its auditors, after lengthy delays in the checking of its accounts. The council’s last set of fully audited accounts was for the 2018-19 financial year. Lee Rowley, a minister in Gove’s department, replied on his behalf, saying the government could not intervene. A Conservative source said: “Sadly, this is the Lib Dems playing politics. It looks like an attempt by the Lib Dems to justify huge council tax hikes on residents.”",business

"Losing Naseem Shah is a huge blow, says Morne Morkel ahead of Sri Lanka clash","Listen to Story On Wednesday, Morne Morkel, the bowling coach for Pakistan, expressed his concern over the absence of Naseem Shah, a key pacer who sustained an injury. He acknowledged that Naseem's absence is a significant setback but remained hopeful that another bowler would rise to the occasion in the crucial Asia Cup Super Four match against Sri Lanka. Naseem suffered a right shoulder injury during a match against India, leading to his withdrawal from the tournament. In his stead, Zaman Khan has been called up as a replacement. As it stands, both Pakistan and Sri Lanka are on equal footing with two points each as they head into the decisive match on Thursday. The victor of this match will secure a spot in the final against India, scheduled for September 17th. Bowling coach Morne Morkel spoke in the pre-match press conference and said that he was excited for the new pacers to step up to the occasion. in the Pakistan playing XI and it would be interesting to see how he deals with the condition. “Obviously, it is a big blow (absence of Naseem). It is unfortunate that he picked some little niggles. But what a fantastic opportunity for the guys you know coming in. After going down against India, it’s a must win game for us tomorrow. I’m quite excited to see new guys stepping in and showing some character,” said Morkel during the pre-match press-conference. “After the India match, we were bitterly disappointed. For me, it is very important for the bowlers to do a bit of self-reflection, ask yourself the hard questions. Yes, credit must also go to the Indian batters,"" the former South Africa speedster further added. “They put us under pressure early. Those are fantastic lessons for us before the World Cup. We are gonna grow from this and come back stronger,” Morkel concluded.",sports
Shreyas Iyer's back spasm keeps India worried ahead of Australia ODI squad selection,"Listen to Story Shreyas Iyer's back injury isn't apparently very serious but concerns remain about his availability for India's final Super 4 game against Bangladesh on Friday as the national selection committee is set to name the squad for the three-match series against Australia sometime during the week. Iyer, who has come back after a long lay-off and back surgery to cure his stress fracture, played against Pakistan and Nepal in the group league stage before pulling out of the match against the arch-rivals at the eleventh hour, complaining back spasms. A clearer picture will emerge on Thursday during the optional training ahead of the Bangladesh game. Those in the know of the things said that there seems to be ''some amount of stiffness'', which will definitely impact his movements during fielding but they are hopeful that it won't turn out to be very serious. The Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee is expected to name the squad for the Australia series sometime during the ongoing week. It could be on the day of the Bangladesh game or prior to the Asia Cup final on Sunday. While the preliminary World Cup squad has been named, the Indian team management will be worried about Iyer's fitness and if he misses the Australia series, he would be really short of match practice with only two warm-up games left before the first match against Australia in Chennai on October 8. KL Rahul has put an end to all fitness worries with his 100 and 39 in the two Super 4 games and even though he still looked a tad rusty initially while keeping to Kuldeep Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja, he did regain a lot of confidence after gathering a few. Ishan Kishan is now a designated outfielder and it is there to be seen whether Iyer, if fit, replaces Kishan in the final Super 4 game against Bangladesh. Kishan, despite a great run in recent ODIs, did seem to struggle on slow tracks but to be fair to him, none of the batters save skipper Rohit Sharma and to some extent Rahul, looked comfortable against left-arm spin of Dunith Wellalage. Travelling reserve Sanju Samson has returned home and Tilak Verma is supposed to join the Asian Games camp after the end of this tournament. Possibly Tilak being a left-hander could pip a more experienced Sanju in worst possible case where he is unable to recover in time. However with two weeks (September 27) left to announce final squad, every stakeholder in Indian cricket will keep its fingers crossed.",sports

Trai plans consultation paper on OTT players,"Synopsis The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) is reportedly planning to release a consultation paper on regulatory issues related to over-the-top (OTT) video platforms such as Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+ Hotstar, and JioCinema. The paper will address concerns such as price parity between OTT platforms and traditional distribution channels, as well as applying broadcasting sector rules to OTT platforms for live content. TOI.in The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) is planning to float a consultation paper on some regulatory issues pertaining to over-the-top (OTT) video platforms like Netflix, Prime Video , Disney+ Hotstar, and JioCinema , people privy to the development told ET. While regulation of OTT content comes under the ambit of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting ( MIB ), the carriage part comes under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). Trai will look into such issues. The consultation paper will deal with issues like bringing price parity between OTT video platforms and traditional distribution platforms like cable TV and direct-to-home (DTH) services and applying some of the rules for the broadcasting sector to OTT when it comes to live content, one of the persons cited above said. While TRAI has neither confirmed nor denied that it is planning to come out with a consultation paper, industry watchers said the consultation process is the first step in formulating rules for a fledgling segment that is making massive losses due to cut-throat competition among over 40 OTT platforms in the country. In the video content industry, broadcast companies are bound by regulations on issues like pricing, bundling, and distribution of content, whereas no such rules exist for OTT players. Trai is likely to issue the consultation paper on a suo-motu basis as it has not received any reference from the government, a second person aware of the development said. An email sent to Trai chairman PD Vaghela didn't elicit any response till press time Wednesday. There have been calls from different stakeholders in the telecom and broadcasting sectors to ensure level-playing field between broadcasting and OTT segments. Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller issued the warning at a briefing in response to questions about the meeting in Russia between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ""We have taken a number of actions already to sanction entities that brokered arms sales between North Korea and Russia and we won't hesitate to impose additional sanctions if appropriate,"" Miller said.

"Apple Says iPhone 12 Meets Radiation Rules, Disputes French Findings","Some estimates say Apple sold over 50 million iPhones last year in Europe. (Representational) Apple defended its iPhone 12 model on Wednesday after a French watchdog ordered a halt to its sales citing breaches of European Union radiation exposure limits. The French move raised the prospect of further bans in Europe. Germany's network regulator BNetzA said it might launch similar proceedings and was in close contact with French authorities, while Spain's OCU consumers' group urged authorities there to halt the sales of the iPhone 12. Apple said in a statement the iPhone 12, launched in 2020, was certified by multiple international bodies as compliant with global radiation standards, that it had provided several Apple and third-party lab results proving the phone's compliance to the French agency, and that it was contesting its findings. Researchers have conducted a vast number of studies over the last two decades to assess health risks resulting from mobile phones. According to the World Health Organisation, no adverse health effects have so far been established as being caused by mobile phone use. France's Agence Nationale des Fréquences (ANFR) told Apple on Tuesday to halt iPhone12 sales in France after tests that it said showed the phone's Specific Absorption Rate (SAR)- a gauge of the rate of radiofrequency energy absorbed by the body from a piece of equipment - was higher than legally allowed. The watchdog said it would send agents to Apple stores and other distributors to check the model was no longer being sold and a failure to act would result in the recall of iPhone 12s already sold to consumers. Industry experts said there were no safety risks as regulatory limits on SAR were set well below levels where scientists have found evidence of harm. ""From a health and safety point of view, it is not as if this is putting anyone at risk,"" said Professor Rodney Croft, the chair of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), which sets global guidelines on the SAR limits. The limits - based on the risk of burns or heatstroke from the phone's radiation - are already set ten times below the level where scientists found evidence of harm. Croft said the French findings could differ from those recorded by other regulators because ANFR assesses radiation with a method that assumes direct skin contact, without intermediate textile layers, between the device and user. A French government source also said the French test was different from the method used by Apple. Smartphone radiation tests have so far led to 42 sales stops in the country. It is the first time Apple has been affected by such a move. Recall Threat The ANFR said accredited labs had found absorption of electromagnetic energy by the body at 5.74 watts per kilogram during tests simulating when the iPhone 12 was being held in the hand or kept in a trouser pocket. The European standard is a specific absorption rate of 4.0 watts per kilogram. ANFR added the tests showed the phone complied with so-called body-SAR standards when it was in a jacket pocket or bag. It also passed the French tests when held directly to the head as if making a phone call. France's junior minister for the digital economy, Jean-Noel Barrot, said a software update would be sufficient to fix the radiation issues. ""Apple is expected to respond within two weeks"", he told daily Le Parisien in an interview on Tuesday, adding: ""If they fail to do so, I am prepared to order a recall of all iPhones 12 in circulation. The rule is the same for everyone, including the digital giants."" ANFR will now pass on its findings to regulators in other European Union member states. ""In practical terms, this decision could have a snowball effect"", said Barrot. ""The procedure in France has a guiding function for Europe as a whole"", said Germany's BNetzA network regulator, adding it might launch similar proceedings in Germany. Germany's radiation watchdog BfS also said the French decision could have implications for all of Europe. Apple doesn't break out its sales by country or model. Its revenues totalled about $95 billion in Europe last year, making the region its second biggest behind the Americas. Some estimates say it sold over 50 million iPhones last year in Europe. The company launched the iPhone 15 on Tuesday. The International Agency for Research on Cancer, which sets global guidelines on SAR limits, classed the radiofrequency electromagnetic fields resulting from mobile phone use as ""possibly carcinogenic"" in 2011. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com This designation - which also includes the sweetener aspartame, aloe vera extract and some pickled vegetables - flags there is limited evidence of something potentially causing cancer, and is also intended to motivate more research.

"ChatGPT Diagnoses Patients ""Like A Human Doctor"", Says Study","ChatGPT diagnosed patients rushed to emergency at least as well as doctors. (Representational) Artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT diagnosed patients rushed to emergency at least as well as doctors and in some cases outperformed them, Dutch researchers have found, saying AI could ""revolutionise the medical field"". But the report published Wednesday also stressed ER doctors needn't hang up their scrubs just yet, with the chatbot potentially able to speed up diagnosis but not replace human medical judgement and experience. Scientists examined 30 cases treated in an emergency service in the Netherlands in 2022, feeding in anonymised patient history, lab tests and the doctors' own observations to ChatGPT, asking it to provide five possible diagnoses. They then compared the chatbot's shortlist to the same five diagnoses suggested by ER doctors with access to the same information, then cross-checked with the correct diagnosis in each case. Doctors had the correct diagnosis in the top five in 87 percent of cases, compared to 97 percent for ChatGPT version 3.5 and 87 percent for version 4.0. ""Simply put, this indicates that ChatGPT was able to suggest medical diagnoses much like a human doctor would,"" said Hidde ten Berg, from the emergency medicine department at the Netherlands' Jeroen Bosch Hospital. Co-author Steef Kurstjens told AFP the survey did not indicate that computers could one day be running the ER, but that AI can play a vital role in assisting under-pressure medics. ""The key point is that the chatbot doesn't replace the physician but it can help in providing a diagnosis and it can maybe come up with ideas the doctor hasn't thought of,"" Kurstjens told AFP. Large language models such as ChatGPT are not designed as medical devices, he stressed, and there would also be privacy concerns about feeding confidential and sensitive medical data into a chatbot. 'Bloopers' And as in other fields, ChatGPT showed some limitations. The chatbot's reasoning was ""at times medically implausible or inconsistent, which can lead to misinformation or incorrect diagnosis, with significant implications,"" the report noted. The scientists also admitted some shortcomings with the research. The sample size was small, with 30 cases examined. In addition, only relatively simple cases were looked at, with patients presenting a single primary complaint. It was not clear how well the chatbot would fare with more complex cases. ""The efficacy of ChatGPT in providing multiple distinct diagnoses for patients with complex or rare diseases remains unverified."" Sometimes the chatbot did not provide the correct diagnosis in its top five possibilities, Kurstjens explained, notably in the case of an abdominal aneurysm, a potentially life-threatening complication where the aorta artery swells up. The only consolation for ChatGPT: in that case the doctor got it wrong too. The report sets out what it calls the medical ""bloopers"" the chatbot made, for example diagnosing anaemia (low haemoglobin levels in the blood) in a patient with a normal haemoglobin count. ""It's vital to remember that ChatGPT is not a medical device and there are concerns over privacy when using ChatGPT with medical data,"" concluded ten Berg. ""However, there is potential here for saving time and reducing waiting times in the emergency department. The benefit of using artificial intelligence could be in supporting doctors with less experience, or it could help in spotting rare diseases,"" he added. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com The findings -- published in the medical journal Annals of Emergency Medicine -- will be presented at the European Emergency Medicine Congress (EUSEM) 2023 in Barcelona.

Even more Google layoffs: This time it’s “significant” cuts to recruiting,"Enlarge Sean Gallup | Getty Images reader comments 15 with Google was once a company that lavished its employees with perks and didn't do layoffs, but that's not the Google of 2023. Even after the 12,000 layoffs from about January to March , a second round of Waymo layoffs in March, and the Waze layoffs in June, Google is now doing another round of layoffs. This time, it's in the recruiting division. Semafor was the first to report that Google is laying off ""hundreds"" of people in its global recruiting organization as part of an overall plan to reduce the number of people it hires in the near future. If you don't have job openings, you don't need recruiters. CNBC received a recording of the internal meeting, with Brian Ong, Google’s recruiting vice president, telling employees the new round of layoffs was ""not something that was an easy decision to make, and it definitely isn’t a conversation any of us wanted to have again this year.” Ong justified the decision, saying, “Given the base of hiring that we’ve received the next several quarters, it’s the right thing to do overall.” Further Reading Google won’t honor medical leave during its layoffs, outraging employees CNBC reports Google has learned from its previous layoffs and will not instantly cut off laid-off employees from access at Google. The ex-Googlers will be granted access to the office for an extra week and online services for longer. Google employees often have more than just a paycheck wrapped up in their employment, with Google offering services like on-site medical facilities. Laid-off employees now have a chance to talk to providers and come up with some kind of post-employment health care plan. A Google spokesperson told CNBC that Google plans to ""meaningfully [slow] the pace of our overall hiring.""",technology
"AI can now generate CD-quality music from text, and it’s only getting better","Enlarge Getty Images reader comments 29 with Imagine typing ""dramatic intro music"" and hearing a soaring symphony or writing ""creepy footsteps"" and getting high-quality sound effects.

Not content to limit itself to generating images, the company branched out into audio by backing Harmonai , an AI lab that launched music generator Dance Diffusion in September. Now Stability and Harmonai want to break into commercial AI audio production with Stable Audio. Judging by production samples , it seems like a significant audio quality upgrade from previous AI audio generators we've seen. On its promotional page, Stability provides examples of the AI model in action with prompts like ""epic trailer music intense tribal percussion and brass"" and ""lofi hip hop beat melodic chillhop 85 bpm."" It also offers samples of sound effects generated using Stable Audio, such as an airline pilot speaking over an intercom and people talking in a busy restaurant. To train its model, Stability partnered with stock music provider AudioSparx and licensed a data set ""consisting of over 800,000 audio files containing music, sound effects, and single-instrument stems, as well as corresponding text metadata."" After feeding 19,500 hours of audio into the model, Stable Audio knows how to imitate certain sounds it has heard on command because the sounds have been associated with text descriptions of them within its neural network. Enlarge / A block diagram of the Stable Audio architecture provided by Stability AI. Stablility AI Stable Audio contains several parts that work together to create customized audio quickly. One part shrinks the audio file down in a way that keeps its important features while removing unnecessary noise. This makes the system both faster to teach and quicker at creating new audio. Another part uses text (metadata descriptions of the music and sounds) to help guide what kind of audio is generated. Advertisement To speed things up, the Stable Audio architecture operates on a heavily simplified, compressed audio representation to reduce inference time (the amount of time it takes for a machine learning model to generate an output once it has been given an input). According to Stability AI, Stable Audio can render 95 seconds of stereo audio at a 44.1 kHz sample rate (often called ""CD quality"") in less than one second on an Nvidia A100 GPU . The A100 is a beefy data center GPU designed for AI use, and it's far more capable than a typical desktop gaming GPU. As mentioned, Stable Audio isn't the first music generator based on latent diffusion techniques. Last December, we covered Riffusion , a hobbyist take on an audio version of Stable Diffusion, though its resulting generations were far from Stable Audio's samples in quality. In January, Google released MusicLM , an AI music generator for 24 kHz audio, and Meta launched a suite of open source audio tools (including a text-to-music generator) called AudioCraft in August. Now, with 44.1 kHz stereo audio, Stable Diffusion is upping the ante. Further Reading Riffusion’s AI generates music from text using visual sonograms Stability says Stable Audio will be available in a free tier and a $12 monthly Pro plan. With the free option, users can generate up to 20 tracks per month, each with a maximum length of 20 seconds. The Pro plan expands these limits, allowing for 500 track generations per month and track lengths of up to 90 seconds. Future Stability releases are expected to include open source models based on the Stable Audio architecture, as well as training code for those interested in developing audio generation models. As it stands, it's looking like we might be on the edge of production-quality AI-generated music with Stable Audio, considering its audio fidelity. Will musicians be happy if they get replaced by AI models? Likely not, if history has shown us anything from AI protests in the visual arts field . For now, a human can easily outclass anything AI can generate, but that may not be the case for long. Either way, AI-generated audio may become another tool in a professional's audio production toolbox.",technology
"PM Modi To Launch Development Projects In Poll-Bound Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh Today","Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to embark on a visit to Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh on Thursday (September 14), where he will inaugurate a series of development initiatives in both states. According to a statement from his office, PM Modi will commence his visit by laying the foundation stone for projects worth over Rs 50,700 crore in Madhya Pradesh, with the event taking place in Bina. Among the projects to be inaugurated in Madhya Pradesh is a petrochemical complex at the Bina refinery, along with ten new industrial projects spread across the state. Later, he will travel to neighbouring Chhattisgarh to inaugurate critical rail sector projects valued at approximately Rs 6,350 crore. It is worth noting that both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are due to hold assembly elections in November-December, the statement said. During the visit, the statement revealed that the Prime Minister will also lay the foundation stone for critical care blocks in nine districts of Chhattisgarh and distribute one lakh sickle cell counselling cards, it said. The statement highlighted that the new projects in Madhya Pradesh will significantly boost industrial development within the state. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); As per the statement, the state-of-the-art Bina refinery, to be developed at a cost of about Rs 49,000 crore by the Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, is expected to produce approximately 1,200 Kilo-Tonnes Per Annum (KTPA) of ethylene and propylene. These are vital components for various sectors, including textiles, packaging, and pharmaceuticals. This initiative aligns with the Prime Minister's vision of 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat' and will reduce India's reliance on imports. Furthermore, the mega project is anticipated to generate employment opportunities and stimulate the growth of downstream industries in the petroleum sector. Modi will also lay the groundwork for ten additional projects during his visit, including a power and renewable energy manufacturing zone in Narmadapuram district, two IT parks in Indore, a mega industrial park in Ratlam, and six new industrial areas across Madhya Pradesh, it said. Modi's focus on enhancing national connectivity will receive a significant boost with the inauguration of crucial rail sector projects in Raigarh, Chhattisgarh. These projects encompass the Chhattisgarh East Rail Project Phase-I, the third rail line between Champa to Jamga, the third rail line between Pendra Road to Anuppur, and the MGR (Merry-Go-Round) system connecting Talaipalli Coal Mine to NTPC Lara Super Thermal Power Station (STPS). These rail projects will not only enhance passenger and freight movement but also contribute to socioeconomic development in the region. The Chhattisgarh East Rail Project Phase-I is a key component of the PM Gati Shakti-National Master Plan for multi-modal connectivity, comprising a 124.8 km rail line from Kharsia to Dharamjaygarh, including a spur line to Gare-Pelma and three feeder lines connecting Chhal, Baroud, Durgapur, and other coal mines, according to the statement. The rail line, constructed at a cost of approximately Rs 3,055 crore, features electrified broad gauge level crossings, a free part double line with passenger amenities, and will facilitate coal transportation from the Mand-Raigarh coalfields in Raigarh, Chhattisgarh. In addition, to address sickle cell disease-related health issues, particularly among tribal populations, Modi will distribute one lakh sickle cell counselling cards to the screened population. This distribution is part of the Prime Minister's National Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination Mission (NSAEM), which was launched in Shahdol, Madhya Pradesh, in July 2023, it said.",politics
"Rodgers, in IG post, says 'I shall rise yet again'","FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers, in his first public comments since his season-ending Achilles injury, said he's down, but apparently not out. ""I'm completely heartbroken and moving through all of the emotions, but deeply touched and humbled by the support and love,"" Rodgers wrote Wednesday in a post on his Instagram page. ""Please keep me in your thoughts and prayers as I begin the healing process today. ""The night is darkest before the dawn. And I shall rise yet again."" Rodgers' comments came shortly after Jets coach Robert Saleh and owner Woody Johnson both indicated they expect the four-time MVP to return in 2024. ""I'd be shocked if this is the way he's going to go out,"" Saleh told reporters. The 39-year-old quarterback, the oldest player in the NFL, faces several months of grueling rehab after tearing his left Achilles tendon on his fourth snap of the season in Monday night's win over the Buffalo Bills. Saleh said he hasn't discussed the future with him, adding that Rodgers is ""working through a whole lot of headspace things that he needs to deal with, and that will be the last thing I talk to him about."" Before the injury, Rodgers had mentioned on numerous occasions that his goal was to play multiple years with the Jets. He's signed through 2025, due to receive $38 million in guarantees in 2024. About three hours before Rodgers' post, Johnson chimed in on social media, saying, ""The story is not over. Come back strong @AaronRodgers12."" In Green Bay, Packers coach Matt LaFleur and quarterback Jordan Love said they texted Rodgers shortly after his injury. ""I would bet that he would have no problem coming back from it,"" LaFleur said. ""I really believe it. I know the type of worker he is, and so it's just going to be a choice of whether or not he wants to continue to play or not."" Love said that he was excited to see Rodgers play and that ""it sucks for that to happen to him in the first series. I feel for him, I know he's going to bounce back, and he'll do his thing in recovery, and he'll come back stronger."" Meanwhile, the Jets are preparing for the Dallas Cowboys (1-0) with Zach Wilson as their starter and Tim Boyle as the backup. Saleh said the team doesn't feel a sense of urgency to add another quarterback even though Wilson and Boyle are the only two in the building. Boyle will be brought up from the practice squad for Sunday's game on the road. At some point, the Jets hope Rodgers will return to the facility to help behind the scenes. Rodgers and Wilson have developed a close relationship over the past few months, and the coaches say it has helped Wilson -- the No. 2 pick in 2021 -- improve his game. ""I think it's very important,"" Saleh said of having Rodgers around the team. ""It's important for him. For him, I think it's the mental health and healing. I think that's very important. But his presence, his words. ... I said he's as much a football coach as he is a player. Just having his presence, his thoughts, his words and his leadership, anybody would want that."" For now, Wilson won't have Rodgers around to tutor him. The Jets are trying to rally around the quarterback who was benched twice last season and demoted to third string late in the year. Several players, when asked about their confidence in Wilson, said the third-year quarterback has shown growth, and they cited Rodgers as a big reason. They noted a difference in Wilson's confidence. ""He has that swagger,"" center Connor McGovern said. ""When he came in, he had a nice swagger about him. I think he lost it a little bit and it's back. It's back and it's better than ever."" Wilson, 8-14 as a starter, replaced Rodgers on the first series of the game. He struggled in the first half, throwing a costly interception, but improved in the second half and threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Garrett Wilson in the 22-16 overtime win. He finished 14-for-21 for 140 yards. ""The past is the past and, from what I'm seeing, Zach is our guy,"" running back Dalvin Cook said. ""We have to rock out with him."" The Jets are exploring quarterback options for depth purposes, but Saleh said they're not in a hurry because they want the right scheme and locker room fit. Meanwhile, Rodgers' former coach with the Packers, Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy, said he reached out to his old quarterback. ""I have a tremendous amount of love for him,"" McCarthy said. ""This is tough. I know he was very excited about this chapter of his life, and I was looking forward to seeing him this weekend. ... You get to see how precious these opportunities are. Every game is such a special opportunity to compete in this league. So, yeah, I think we're all feeling for him personally right now."" ESPN's Rob Demovsky and Todd Archer contributed to this report.",sports

"This Country Bans Sale Of iPhone 12 For Radiation Scare, Apple Denies Charges","Apple has launched new iPhones this week but the company also made the news for some concerning issues. Apple has been forced to stop selling the iPhone 12 model in France by the Ministry, as it is allegedly above the threshold of radiation levels in the country. The remarks were reportedly made by France’s Junior Minister this week. The radiation monitoring agency of France, AFNR has already notified Apple about its decision to ban the specific iPhone model. The agency has taken this call after claiming to have carried out tests on the iPhone 12 which showed that the phone’s Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) level was higher than what France allows phone manufacturers. It is interesting that Apple has been called by the French Government over the SAR issue, and the problem seems to be limited to the iPhone 12 model. Apple has defended the charges put forth by the French government, claiming that the particular iPhone model meets all the radiation standards, and tests have been done to prove those claims. The company says that the iPhone model launched in 2020 has been certified by multiple international bodies and got the all-clear for the iPhone being compliant with global radiation standards. Apple is understandably miffed by these developments, and it says will be contesting these findings. The French Ministry’s notification to Apple clearly states that they want the model to be removed from the market. It is even willing to order a recall for all iPhone 12 models that have been sold in the country. This is probably the first time we have heard about Apple with regard to SAR issues, which have mostly been associated with Chinese phone companies over the years. While Apple seems confident about clearing its charges, the brand is likely to be concerned about the possible snowball effect of this order, which could be followed by other EU nations in the coming months.

Samsung Could Bring Its Galaxy Smart Ring At The Galaxy S24 Launch Event,"Samsung Galaxy S24 event early next year promises to be a blockbuster, not only because the new Galaxy S24 smartphone will be unveiled, but a new product category will be showcased in front of the world. According to a post by a tipster, the South Korean brand could use the next Galaxy Unpacked event in January 2024 to reveal the first-ever Galaxy Ring in front of the world. We still don’t know much about the product from Samsung but all signs have suggested that the smart ring definitely has a future, that too very soon. the company got a patent for a smart ring back in 2015, which means Samsung always aspired to have a product in this form. The recent explosion in this segment means that Samsung could have strong grounds to explore the product category, and having a patent for the device and the name Galaxy Ring pretty much leads them to the finishing line. The patent for the device explained that the smart ring will allow you to control smart home devices, dimming the lights, and other activities, simply by twisting the ring on your wrist. The Galaxy Ring was spotted in the Samsung Health Beta app by a Reddit user earlier this year. And since the device has been mentioned in the Health platform, it is likely that Samsung could enhance the features of the rumoured Galaxy Ring and offer health-tracking on the device as well. The tipster claims that Samsung could bring the smart ring as the primary device for health tracking, pushing the Galaxy Watch lineup into the backdrop. Samsung is unlikely to be the last tech giant to enter the smart ring market. Apple is heavily rumoured to be eyeing this space as well and could bring a product in the coming years. It goes without saying that the scope for a ring to be an effective health tracker is quite good, as you can wear it like a normal ring, without any screen to bother. But the alerts will be buzzing on the fingers, which would need some getting used to when the product becomes official.",technology
iPhone 15 USP Feature Is Dynamic Island: What Is it? [Explained],"Apple iPhone 15 series didn’t show many big surprises during the launch event this week, including the fact that Apple is taking the Dynamic Island notch to all the iPhone 15 models this year. This a feature, software-based built into the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max variants last year, and now the company is offering on four iPhone 15 models. There was a lot of excitement around Dynamic Island when it was introduced by Apple last year, and now more people will get a chance to experience the feature without burning a hole in their pocket to buy the iPhone 15 Pro or 15 Pro Max model. So what is the Dynamic Island that is now one of the USPs for the iPhone 15 buyers and what does it offer to the users? Here’s a detailed look at the feature and its use case. Dynamic Island is Apple’s version of a wide notch that can do live activities at the top of the iPhone’s screen. iPhones have come with a wide notch since the iPhone X model was introduced but Apple decided to shake things up with the notch on the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max last year. You could also say that Dynamic Island is a secondary display to view content (limited features) on the iPhone’s screen. Apple mentions that you can check alerts, and see the progress of current activities like food delivery or cab status on the Dynamic Island. But that’s not all, you can also get the current music playing, and directions for Apple Maps. The Dynamic Island shows up whenever you unlock the iPhone. Apple explains that Dynamic Island allows you to use different live activities that are compatible with their respective apps. Here’s how the feature works: - Touch and hold the activity on the Dynamic Island - Swipe from the center to the right - Swipe from the right - Swipe from left to center - Swipe from one side or the other Apple is still in the early phases with Dynamic Island and it needs developer interest and support to build more features into the live activities section. For now, the options are limited but the potential is definitely there and finally more iPhone users can experience the technology.",technology

India Calls for Investigation Into US Cop Joking About Indian Student Jaahnavi Kandula’s Death (Watch Video),"New York, September 14: India said it has ""strongly"" taken up the case of its national Jaahnavi Kandula with authorities in the US, following the release of a bodycam video in which a cop is heard joking and laughing about the Indian student's death by a police patrol car this year. In the brief clip, Seattle Police Officers’ Guild Vice President Daniel Auderer is seen driving and can be heard saying, ""she had limited value"", in a call with the guild’s president, Mike Solan, The Seattle Times reported this week. The Consulate General of India in San Francisco on Wednesday termed the incident as ""deeply troubling"". ""We have taken up the matter strongly with local authorities in Seattle & Washington State as well as senior officials in Washington D.C. for a thorough investigation & action against those involved in this tragic case,"" the consulate said in a post on X (formerly Twitter). ""The Consulate & Embassy will continue to closely follow up on this matter with all concerned authorities,"" it added. Jaahnavi Kandula Accident Video: Body Cam Footage Shows Moments Before US Cop Kevin Dave mowed Down Indian-Origin Woman Kandula, a 23-year-old student of Northeastern University campus in South Lake Union, was walking near Dexter Avenue North and Thomas Street when she was hit by a Seattle Police vehicle driven by Kevin Dave on January 23. Auderer, who was assigned to check whether Dave was under any influence, inadvertently left his body camera on, in which he was heard laughing and saying that Kandula’s life had “limited value” and the city should “just write a check”. “Eleven thousand dollars. She was 26 anyway,” Auderer said, adding Dave was “going 50 (miles an hour)"", stating how “that’s not out of control” for a trained driver. A police investigation released in June found that Dave was actually travelling at 74 miles an hour in a 25 mile an hour zone while responding to a different call when Kandula was hit and thrown more than 100 feet. The SPD said in a statement released on Monday that the video of Auderer’s call “was identified in the routine course of business by a department employee”, and was escalated to Chief Adrian Diaz.

The death toll was revised on Wednesday morning local time, according to health ministry undersecretary of the Unity Government in Tripoli, Saadeddin Abdul Wakil. According to workers, mortuaries are overflowing in hospitals that are still closed despite the pressing need to treat disaster survivors. As per Egypt's emigration ministry, the government buried 87 Egyptian victims who died in Libya. Storm Daniel in Libya: 2,000 Bodies Found, Flooding Displaces at Least 30,000 People Authorities fear 10,000 more people remain missing, maybe swept out to sea or buried beneath rubble strewn over the metropolis that formerly housed over 100,000 people. The flooding in Derna has displaced over 30,000 people, according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) in Libya. The extensive damage to the region's infrastructure has rendered some affected areas inaccessible to humanitarian organisations, CNN reported. Only two of the seven entry points to Derna are presently open. Libya: More Than 2,000 Dead After Catastrophic Floods Officials are digging amid mountains of wreckage for survivors and bodies in order to honour Islamic traditions that the dead should be buried within three days, according to CNN. Storm Daniel's devastation has made it considerably more difficult for rescuers to remove roads and debris in order to find survivors. The storm disrupted communications, complicating rescue attempts and raising concern among family members living outside Libya who are waiting for word on missing loved ones.

"With eye on Iran, US signs new security agreement with Bahrain","Listen to Story The US on Wednesday (local time) signed an agreement with Bahrain to enhance defence and economic ties, a show of support for the Gulf monarchy that a decade ago faced an arms embargo. Bahrain -- which has tense relations with nearby Iran -- is already home to the US Navy's Fifth Fleet, but the agreement will solidify the relationship both symbolically and by boosting cooperation, including through a commitment to share intelligence. The agreement will allow ""us to even better determine or respond to threats as they arise"", Secretary of State Antony Blinken said before a signing ceremony with Bahrain's Crown Prince, Prime Minister Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa. ""The heart of the agreement is a shared goal -- working together to build a region that is more secure, more prosperous and that's more connected to the world,"" Blinken said. Dubbed the Comprehensive Security Integration and Prosperity Agreement, the deal will also promote scientific exchanges, investment opportunities and work on renewable energy. In what Blinken billed as a first-of-a-kind measure, the agreement will commit the two countries to work together on ""trusted technologies"" -- an allusion to avoiding providers, often from China, seen by the US as potentially unsafe. The agreement will focus ""not only on security and defence, which is essential, but also on the economy, on people and on technology, which will be the foundation for a new global architecture"", Prince Khalifa said. Bahrain came under criticism in 2011 when, backed by fellow Sunni Kingdom Saudi Arabia, it crushed an uprising led by the Shiite community that demanded a constitutional monarchy and an elected prime minister. Then US President Barack Obama imposed an arms embargo for four years. Bahrain returned to US's good graces under former president Donald Trump, who hailed Bahrain's recognition of Israel. Blinken said the US would raise with the kingdom the issue of human rights with a goal of ""ensuring that fundamental freedoms are protected, which contributes to Bahrain's progress"".

Is Trudeau quitting as Canada PM? He says 'there's grumbling but...',"Listen to Story Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday (local time) brushed aside the idea he might quit due to poor polling numbers, saying he still had plenty of work to do, but acknowledged public grumbling about the cost of living. Polls show that after nine years in power, the left-leaning Liberals were badly trailing the official opposition Conservatives and would lose power if an election were held now. Although Trudeau has a deal with the smaller left-of-centre New Democrats that will allow them to govern until October 2025, the agreement is non-binding and could collapse earlier. ""We're two years away from the next election. I'm continuing to do my job,"" Trudeau told reporters in London, Ontario, when asked whether he had considered stepping down. ""There's a lot of important work to do ... I remain enthusiastic and relentless when it comes to that work."" The Conservatives accused Trudeau of fuelling inflation through what they called reckless government spending. They complained that housing was becoming increasingly unaffordable. Liberal legislators have complained anonymously to domestic media that Trudeau's team does not have a plan to rebut Conservative attacks that focus on the high cost of living. ""There is grumbling across the country. ... the cost of living is causing enormous difficulties,"" Trudeau said. Trudeau, on the sidelines of a Liberal caucus meeting before Parliament resumes next week, said he and fellow legislators would be having frank conversations about how best to address the government's challenges.",world

"""It Was Becoming A Hassle"": Ashwin's Intriguing Take On ODI Powerplay Rules","Ravichandran Ashwin believes that the new ODI Powerplay rules that were implemented in 2015 were aimed at curbing India's dominance on the world stage on the back of their spin attack. In a recent interaction, Ashwin recalled that India were a dominant side back in 2013-14 with the spinners playing a massive role but it all changed with the implementation of the new rules. With two new balls allowed and changes in field restrictions, the game became slightly tilted towards the batters and Ashwin remarked that it was one of the main reasons why the games started becoming quite high-scoring. “Team India were dominating ODI cricket in the period during 2013-14. One of the main reasons for that was we did not have 5 fielders inside the circle rule and the two new balls rule. I somewhere feel India's dominance with spin was choking world cricket,"" Ashwin said on his official YouTube channel. ""(Ravindra) Jadeja and I were the two spinners at that time. Yuvraj (Singh) and Yusuf (Pathan) used to chip in with some overs. With four fielders inside the circle, it was very difficult to get away in the middle overs. But then they implemented the two new balls rule and all brought the 5 fielders inside the circle rule. Once they did that, the 240-250-260 games disappeared,” the veteran spinner added. Ashwin also praised KL Rahul and said that he is slowly becoming a perfect middle-order batter. “Apparently KL Rahul was not supposed to play that game. Shreyas Iyer was going to play that game initially. I have always maintained KL Rahul at No. 5 is a lock. ODI cricket should have its ebbs and flows. KL Rahul is giving us the stability with the bat in the middle order."" That's why batting in the middle order is really difficult. MS Dhoni nailed that art. I am not comparing MS Dhoni and KL Rahul at all. But I feel he is slowly mastering his role perfectly."" he explained.",sports
"CA's Mandatory Neck Guard Rule Could Force Smith, Warner To Fall In Line","Veteran batters Steven Smith and David Warner could be forced to wear neck guards as Cricket Australia has made it mandatory for international and domestic players to do so from October 1. Under the new playing conditions for 2023-24, every Australian player on international and domestic cricket will be required to wear neck protectors fixed or fitted to the rear of helmets when facing fast or medium pace bowling in all CA-sanctioned competitions, according to cricket.com.au. The regulation update came a week after all-rounder Cameron Green was struck by a Kagiso Rabada bouncer on the neck guard fixed to his helmet and substituted out of the first ODI against South Africa with concussion at Bloemfontein on September 7. The move will impact several Australian players, including David Warner and Steve Smith, who have resisted using the neck guards since their introduction in 2015. Usman Khawaja also do not currently wear the protectors when batting. CA will make wearing neck protection at international training and matches mandatory via a change to its clothing and equipment regulations, the report said. The rule does not apply to facing spinners or for wicketkeepers and close-in fielders. CA had recommended the use of neck protectors since their introduction in 2015 following the tragic death of Phillip Hughes but several veteran players have been reluctant to take them up. Smith had earlier said the neck guards made him ""feel claustrophobic"". He was not wearing a neck guard when struck by a Jofra Archer dfelivery at Lord's in the 2019 Ashes. Warner said in 2016 that he does ""not and will not wear"" one because it ""digs into"" his neck and is an ""uncomfortable distraction"". Australia international players will now be required to wear neck guards during both home and away matches. Although international umpires won't enforce the regulation like in domestic cricket, players could face sanctions under CA's code of conduct for a breach of clothing and equipment regulations, the report said. Among other changes, CA has removed the COVID-19 substitute rule from its playing conditions in line with the ICC doing the same.",sports
"Drew Barrymore Dropped As Host by NB Awards amid Hollywood Writers’ Strike, National Book Foundation Issues Statement","Actor Drew Barrymore has been removed as National Book Awards host due to her decision to resume filming her talk show during the Hollywood writers' strike.

""The National Book Awards is an evening dedicated to celebrating the power of literature, and the incomparable contributions of writers to our culture.

But earlier this week she announced her show would be returning, drawing anger from members of both the WGA and SAG-AFTRA. Barrymore insisted that her talk show, set to return for its fourth season on September 18, will abide by the rules of the strike. ""I made a choice to walk away from the MTV, film and television awards because I was the host and it had a direct conflict with what the strike was dealing with which was studios, streamers, film, and television. It was also in the first week of the strike and so I did what I thought was the appropriate thing at the time to stand in solidarity with the writers. And to be clear, our talk show actually wrapped on April 20th so we never had to shut down the show. However, I am also making the choice to come back for the first time in this strike for our show, that may have my name on it but this is bigger than just me,"" she wrote. A post shared by Drew Barrymore (@drewbarrymore) She added, ""I own this choice. We are in compliance with not discussing or promoting film and television that is struck of any kind. We launched live in a global pandemic. Our show was built for sensitive times and has only functioned through what the real world is going through in real time. I want to be there to provide what writers do so well, which is a way to bring us together or help us make sense of the human experience. I hope for a resolve for everyone as soon as possible.

"Watch: UK-Based Chef Prepares Sindhi Aloo Tuk, Internet Applauds","If you have never tried Sindhi food, you are definitely missing out. Sindhi cuisine has several finger-licking dishes, with both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. Wondering what has got us talking about this cuisine today? It is a video currently taking the internet by storm. UK-based food vlogger and cook Jake Dryan recently shared an Instagram reel showing his efforts to prepare a delectable Sindhi treat known as Aloo Tuk . Jake, who is popular for his Indian food cooking videos, has also stated that this is one of his “favourite recipes from Sindhi week.” Also Read: Watch: Viral Video Of 'Roasted Milk Tea' Has Made Chai Lovers Angry He begins the video by soaking peeled potatoes in water for some time. He chops all the potatoes in equal halves and then deep-fries them until they turned golden from the outside and were properly cooked from the inside. After properly straining out the oil, he uses the back of the mug to flatten the fired potatoes. Once they are all flat like unevenly shaped aloo tikki, Jake puts the potatoes back in the oil to fry them for the second time. In this way, he manages to get that perfect golden brown crispy coating, without even dipping the potato in any slurry. After the potatoes are ready, the next step is to prepare the masala. For this, Jake mixes turmeric, chilli powder, ground cumin, ground coriander, garam masala, amchur powder, dried red chilli and salt. He then combined the fried potatoes with the masala. He was seen tasting it after garnishing the aloo tuk with chopped coriander leaves and lemon. Watch the full video below: A post shared by JAKE DRYAN (@plantfuture) Also Read: Portuguese Town's Streets Turn Red With Wine After Distillery Accident, X Reacts The video has received 2.4 million views so far.

"""It's Not Easy To..."": India Coach On Decision To Drop Mohammed Shami","India bowling coach Paras Mhambrey on Thursday said the return of Jasprit Bumrah has strengthened their pace unit and it is pleasing to have four fully-fit fast bowlers going into next month's World Cup. During the recent tour to Ireland, Bumrah wore India colours after a long injury layoff, and impressed with his intensity during the ongoing Asia Cup as well. ""We have been following Bumrah's progress from the NCA, and we are very happy with the report that we have got. ""Now, we have four quality bowlers, and it is always great to have those options. The problem of plenty is always good,"" Mhambrey said ahead of India's final Super 4 match against Bangladesh on Friday. However, India's first-choice pace attack is now centred around Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj and Hardik Pandya, forcing the management to bench Mohammed Shami. ""It's not very easy to drop someone like Shami. The experience that he has and the performance that he has done for the country is phenomenal. It's never easy to have that kind of a conversation (dropping a player),"" he said. Mhambrey said while it was a difficult choice, the player concerned has been conveyed clearly about the team decision. ""But we are clear in the way we have gone about the conversation with the players and they have shown confidence in us. ""Players know any decision that we take and they know that it is for the benefit of the team,"" said Mhambrey. The former India pacer was also delighted to see the strides Pandya has taken as a bowler in recent times. ""I am very happy with the way Hardik has shaped up, something that we have worked on for a long time. We have been managing his workload, making sure that he is fit and able to achieve what we expect out of him. Advertisement ""Once he hits 140 kmph he is a different bowler. From the team perspective it's a wicket-taking option that we have,"" added Mhambrey. Mhambrey also said the Indian team has undertaken the process of developing the bowling skills of some batsmen, so that they have more options to choose from when needed. Tilak Varma features prominently in that scheme. ""“I have been working with Tilak since his U-19 days. We were in South Africa and we realised he has bowling skills. We are working on it consistently. ""If the captain gets confidence that he can bowl one over and deliver, this one over can turn into two overs. But it depends on circumstances where we need that extra bowler,"" he said. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",sports

In case, rain plays spoilsport in SL vs PAK Super Four fixture, both the teams will be forced to share points and will end up 3 points from 3 matches. In such a scenario, it will be the Net Run Rate (NRR) which will come into picture to decide who forges ahead in the competition. That would mean bad news for Pakistan since their NRR has taken a beating after the heavy defeat to India and currently stands at -1.892, the lowest among the four teams. Sri Lanka, by contast, have a better NRR of -0.200 and if rain abandons play in Colombo on September 14 (Thursday), then they would be the side against India in the final.",sports

On-device Siri processing might resolve one of the biggest pain points of using the Apple Watch,"Alongside the iPhone 15 announcement, Apple introduced the Apple Watch Series 9 this week. It was a relatively minor iterative update, but one feature in particular caught my attention: offline Siri. Siri can be frustrating at the best of times, but it is particularly poor on the Apple Watch due to its seemingly unstable network connection. A long pause and a “Working on that” announcement is an ever too common experience. Offline Siri with the Apple Watch Series 9 could make this a thing of the past. The way Siri worked up to now is that you would talk into your Watch’s microphone, your audio samples are transcribed into text on device, but interpretation of that text required sending that text to Apple’s cloud of Siri servers. The watch would then have to wait for a response back before being able to enact your request. It doesn’t matter if what you were asking was trivial or obvious, even for the simplest queries, the Watch needed to talk to a server in order to actually respond to your request. And the Watch’s network connection is slow and unreliable. The Watch falls back on Bluetooth relay via the iPhone whenever it can to maximize power efficiency, but this isn’t exactly the fastest method of wireless networking. Out of range of the iPhone, the situation is even worse as you are then at the mercy of the Watch’s small and weak Wi-Fi and/or cellular radios. This is where the Series 9 could be a big step up and the Siri loading spinner could become a thing of the past. Backed by the increased power of the S9 chip, Apple is running natural language machine learning models on the watch itself, so some queries can be handled entirely offline, without talking to a server at all. There is no longer a dependency on the Watch’s flakey internet connection, which should dramatically speed up common actions. I am relatively confident that this will work as advertised as Apple already rolled out a similar change to Siri on iPhones starting in 2021, improving response times and privacy. The one big question is what kinds of “basic” queries will the Watch will be able to handle on its own, and what will still need to fall back to server-side processing. That list hasn’t been confirmed yet. We’ll find out for sure when the Series 9 launches next week, but I’m confident that two things I really care about will be covered — starting workouts and setting timers. Apple used workouts as the Siri demo during the keynote, so that’s already a surety.",technology

"Watch: Viral Video Shows Making Of Pani Puri In Factory, Impresses Internet","Whether you know it as pani puri or golgappas, this humble street snack rules every foodie's heart. The combination of spicy water, along with flavourful filling and tangy chutney, tantalizes our taste buds and leaves us craving for more with each bite. However, the only concern revolving around this street food is hygiene. Thoughts such as whether the vendor is wearing gloves or if the water he uses is safe for drinking often convince foodies to skip the golgappa outing. But it seems that a viral video has an ultimate solution to our concern. This, after a clip making rounds on the internet, gives a glance at the preparation of the packaged pani puris. The best part is that in none of the steps was the involvement of human hands required. Also Read: Watch: Video Of 'Hygienic' Coconut Water Cart Goes Viral; Internet Reacts The video, which was shared by a food vlogger, was recorded at a factory in Surat, Gujarat. It opens with countless golgappas coming out from a container and being fried in flat heavy machinery. Then, someone poured an entire sack of flour and an equivalent amount of water into a big container that kneaded the mixture, which was further converted into a flat sheet. All of this without any human hands involved. Next, a massive roller with round-shaped plates is pressed on top of the flat sheet. This step gives you a perfect round-shaped golgappa. Once the finely sliced golgappas are ready, they are fried in a giant fryer and strained through a moving tray with rods. Lastly, they are sealed in a packet.

Elon Musk Made His Ex Amber Heard Cosplay An ‘Overwatch’ Character; Shares Pic And Gets Roasted With Memes,"The newly released biography of Elon Musk by acclaimed biographer and New York Times bestseller author Walter Isaacson is revelatory of the impulsive, eccentric life of the tech mogul.

James Webb Telescope Peers Into Saturn's Seasonal Mysteries And Finds Something Really Interesting!,"NASA's James Webb Telescope, which is like the ultimate space spy, has been peeking on Saturn, and it's found something really interesting. A group of space scientists discovered that as Saturn's late northern summer turns into autumn it's actually getting cooler. This is happening because the giant air currents on the planet have changed direction. Using fancy pictures from the super-powerful James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), scientists have made some cool discoveries. They got a final look at Saturn's north pole, where there's a big swirl of warm gases before it goes all dark and cold in the polar winter. These findings, shared by University of Leicester researchers in the Journal of help us understand how Saturn's seasons are changing. Professor Leigh Fletcher, from the university's School of Physics and Astronomy, expressed amazement at the fantastic quality of the new data from JWST. Saturn is a bit like Earth in that it tilts on its side and has seasons but Saturn's seasons are super long because it takes Saturn a whopping 30 years to go around the Sun. So, when summer ends in the northern part of Saturn it's also ending here on Earth. SEE ALSO: Right now, as we approach September, we're getting ready for the autumn equinox in the northern hemisphere of Earth. But Saturn is on a different schedule. It's going to have its northern autumn equinox in 2025. That means both Saturn and Earth are going to have really long winters at their north poles. In the picture made by combining different kinds of light seen by JWST's MIRI, we can spot something interesting. At Saturn's north pole there's a bright blue glow that comes from heat. Right at the pole there's a warm cyclone sort of like a giant spinning storm which the Cassini mission first saw. Around this cyclone, there's a wider area filled with warm gases, and they call it the north-polar stratospheric vortex. This whole thing happened because Saturn was going from spring to summer. These warm swirling patterns are quite high up in the sky and they get heated by the Sun during Saturn's long summer. But as we get closer to the autumn equinox in 2025, this warm vortex at Saturn's north pole will start to cool down and vanish because Saturn's northern hemisphere is heading into its dark and chilly autumn.",science
'Inflation Expected To Remain Too High For Too Long': ECB Raises Key Interest Rates By 25 Basis Points,"The European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday hiked its key interest rate by 25 basis points to fight inflation that it expects to ""remain too high for too long."" Following the revision the interest rate on the main refinancing operations, the interest rates on the marginal lending facility, and the deposit facility will be increased to 4.50 per cent, 4.75 per cent, and 4.00 per cent, respectively, with effect from September 20, 2023. The ECB in a statement said, ""Inflation continues to decline but is still expected to remain too high for too long. The governing council is determined to ensure that inflation returns to its 2 per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. The key ECB interest rates have reached levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to the target."" According to an AFP report, the eurozone central bank has increased its lending rate for the 10th consecutive time as part of its aggressive effort, starting July last year, to combat rising inflation, which surged after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The current hike comes despite calls for a pause to support the struggling eurozone economy, marking the longest streak of rate hikes in the central bank's history. This rate is now at its highest level since the euro was introduced in 1999. The central bank believes that these rate increases have now reached a level that will help bring inflation back to its target. Some analysts interpret this move as a signal that the current cycle of rate hikes may be coming to an end, the report said. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); The ECB also raised its forecast for inflation this year and next.

The lawsuit aimed to reclaim Rs 146 crore from Subhash Chandra Goenka. Meanwhile, SEBI has imposed a one-year ban on Zee's CEO, Punit Goenka and Chairman Subhash Chandra Goenka. Punit Goenka becoming the CEO of the merged entity was reportedly the key part of the merger scheme. In response, Zee has established an interim committee overseen by its board to manage operations.

NASA's Webb Telescope Captures Jaw-Dropping Supersonic Star Show!,"NASA's James Webb Space Telescope is showing us incredible pictures of the stuff coming out of a young star. This star called Herbig-Haro 211, is like a baby version of our Sun when it was just a few tens of thousands of years old. In the future it will become a star similar to our Sun. Herbig-Haro objects come to life when baby stars shoot out powerful winds or gas streams into space. These energetic flows crash into surrounding dust and gas at incredible speeds creating intense shockwaves. HH 211 a celestial object found in the Perseus constellation, is just around 1,000 light-years away from us and is among the youngest and closest examples of this phenomenon marking the early stages of star formation. The picture displays a bunch of curved shockwaves in two directions: one going to the southeast (lower-left) and the other to the northwest (upper-right). These shockwaves are created by a narrow pair of jets that come from a central star. The James Webb Space Telescope (Webb) has given us an incredibly detailed view of this scene, with 5 to 10 times more clarity than any previous images of HH 211. NASA says that the inner jet looks like it's 'wiggling' with a matching pattern on both sides of the central star. This observation agrees with what we've seen on smaller scales and hints that the central star might actually be two stars close together, too close to tell apart in this image.",science

Hum Toh Deewane Poster Out! Elvish Yadav and Urvashi Rautela's Romantic Song to Be Out on September 14 . Music production is a key component of any song, as apart from just the sound alone, production gives off the intended mood of the track, and for "" Hum Toh Deewane"", the sound design is very typical of most Bollywood music. The sound space is very open and has a level of glittering polish, with all the acoustics, instrumentation and sampling coming out in great light. This helps to only accentuate the vocals of Yasser Desai, who belts out some very filmy, but heartfelt notes, giving a great performance. All of this sells the audio, with everything right from the sound design to the melodies and vocal performance with its stylistic choices, creating the feeling of a strong, vibrant and blooming romance. The music video for the love anthem is also high-key production, set in a very typical small town setting, with Elvish’s friend asking him about the new ""systum "" , to which Elvish classily responds; “Son, you don’t break a system, you have to create one,” in reference to his own ‘systum’ from Bigg Boss OTT 2 which ultimately made him the ‘Boss’.

The date cements their romance as the two hang out multiple times after that, with the song ending as the two celebrate Diwali under the hue of bright lights, watching firecrackers light up the night sky.

Arm shares set to soar as UK chipmaker joins the Nasdaq – business live,"From 5h ago 14.42 BST Arm rings Nasdaq opening bell to mark stock market float Over in New York, executives from UK chip designer Arm have just rung the Nasdaq opening bell, to mark its stock market flotation. Photograph: Nasdaq Cambridge-based Arm, owned by Japanese giant Softbank, is joining the US stock market with a valuation of around $52.3bn. Last night it priced its shares at the top of its expected range, $51 each, having seen strong interest from investors. This makes Arm’s float the biggest IPO of 2023 so far – in a year when flotations have been relatively rare, due to market volatility. Arm staff, celebrating its IPO Photograph: Nasdaq Ipek Ozkardeskaya , senior analyst at Swissquote Bank , says all eyes in the equities world are on Arm today as it goes public, adding: The company set its IPO price to $51 a share. It’s at the top end of the proposed price range, but still lower than the valuation of $64bn when Softbank bought out a stake from Vision Fund.

Arm set a price of $51 a share, valuing the company at $54.5bn on Wednesday . But as trading began on Thursday morning, investor appetite for the company’s initial public offering (IPO) pushed its share price up 10% to $56.10, valuing the company at just below $60bn. It later rose by as much as 20% up, before settling back at 17% up, giving a valuation of around $64bn. Founded in Cambridge in 1990 as Advanced Risc Machines, Arm supplies chipmakers with circuit designs and is the dominant supplier to the mobile phone market with its circuitry in 99% of smartphones. Japanese investment company SoftBank bought Arm for £24bn ($32bn) in 2016. UK chip designer Arm soars on Nasdaq debut to notch $60bn valuation Read more 50m ago 19.09 BST Arm’s share price in early trading gave the company a market capitalisation of $63.6bn based on shares outstanding, or nearly $66.2bn on a fully diluted basis, the Financial Times reports. More here . 1h ago 19.02 BST Wall Stret is rallying today, as investors take their lead from the gains in Europe earlier. The Dow Jones industrial average is currently up 319 points, or 0.9%, at 34,894 points, with traders also cheered by Arm’s IPO. 1h ago 18.46 BST George Sweeney DipFA, deputy editor at the personal finance comparison site, finder.com , reminds us that London missed out on the Arm IPO – with Softbank preferring to list in New York. Sweeney writes: A surprisingly strong start to trading for Arm has seen its share price break the $60 mark, substantially above what most analysts predicted . This could be partly due to the fact that the IPO became oversubscribed, providing leverage to demand a higher price. Even so, Owners of Arm (SoftBank) had been pushing for an even higher valuation after it paid $16bn to acquire 25% of Arm from one of its own venture capital funds, Vision Fund. Although this is an exciting opportunity to invest in a chipmaker in its early stages, it will be a tough challenge for Arm to grow and keep pace with the more well-established global players. As an example, Nvidia grew 127% in their first year of trading back in 1999 and is now a much larger business than Arm. Retail investors should also be alert to the risk of Arm’s stock price falling back after this initial flurry of interest. Amidst all the noise of this IPO, it’s worth remembering that listing on the FTSE could have been a logical move for the british-based firm and it would have been the one of the largest 14 constituents of the FTSE 100 based on its live market cap. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case and is a reminder of the struggles that London is having post-Brexit. 1h ago 18.41 BST Today’s jump in Arm’s share price, currently up 18% at just over $60, lifts the company’s value to over $60bn. 1/ Arm Holdings has commenced trading on the Nasdaq, with its shares priced at $51 each in the IPO.

Current owner Softbank has listed less than 10% of Arm’s float, and a large chunk of this is expected to have been snapped-up by major tech companies that are Arm customers. Based on its most recent annual earnings, Arm is coming to market with a valuation multiple of around 98x – three-times the average on the Nasdaq 100. Arm shares are rising in initial trade but are proving volatile. Arm is underpinning its valuation on new prospects stemming from a shift in strategy that will see it design more comprehensive, advanced and financially-rewarding chips rather than the business as it is today. Rising US-China tensions may cause concern for Arm as it threatens to disrupt its second largest market. 2h ago 18.22 BST Following a heavily oversubscribed IPO, ARM has started its first day of trading with a bang, says Ben Barringer, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot. This will delight Softbank, which still owns around 90% of Arm , and also the cornerstone investors from the big tech world who have backed the IPO. Barringer adds: “Now much of this is clearly hype and a bit of market froth, particularly as it has been starved of high profile IPOs in recent years. But with interest rates seeming to have peaked, growth companies are coming back into vogue at a time when artificial intelligence threatens to change the world as we know it. With only 10% of the company up for grabs in this IPO, pricing in the early stages will be quite volatile, so we won’t know the true value for some time. For example, ARM’s Q3 results won’t be until 14 th November. However, investors, and especially those in big tech, clearly recognise ARM’s unique status. Its licensing and royalty business model gives it clear sight of its earnings and will sustain it even in difficult environments. Not only that, it has invested heavily and diversified its offering since being acquired by Softbank and has also continued to have an entrenched and dominant position in smartphone processors. Expectations are big for Arm, though, and growth is expected to accelerate quickly in 2024. Barringer explains: Margins could go as high as 60% in the long-term if it can continue to grow its market share, expand its offering and increases its royalty rates. “There are clearly risks around ARM China and the Softbank’s 90% stock overhang. However, this is a strong start and will be a key indicator for more tech firms looking to come to the public markets. ARM will be the story to watch for the rest of the year and beyond.” 3h ago 17.27 BST Arm’s shares are racing higher on the Nasdaq – they’re now up 20%, at over $61 per share. Arm’s share price as it floats Photograph: Marketwatch Updated at 18.19 BST 3h ago 17.16 BST Arm shares jump 10% at the open Newsflash: shares in Arm have opened sharply above the chipmaker’s IPO price, as Wall Street traders scramble for a piece of the UK chipmaker. Reuters reports that Arm Holdings have opened at $56.10 each in its Nasdaq debut, a day after owner Softbank sold shares at $51 each. That’s an increase of 10% on the IPO price, which was itself at the top of Softbank’s range , and valued the company at over $52bn. Today’s opening price values Arm at $57.5bn, by my maths. This strong interest is partly because Softbank, which acquired Arm in 2016, is only floating around 10% of the business on the US stock market. $ARM HOLDINGS OPEN AT $56.1 EACH IN NASDAQ DEBUT VS IPO PRICE OF $51 EACH. — Axel Karlsson (@NordnetAxel) September 14, 2023 My colleague Hibaq Farah writes: The chip designer predicts on its website that 70% of the world’s population use Arm-based technology. Without its designs, the iPhone and other smartphones would not work. The global chip powerhouse employs more than 5,000 people. Arm’s valuation is exceedingly high for a chip company when compared with other firms in its market, other than semiconductor-maker Nvidia, which is worth more than $1tn . 3h ago 17.08 BST A billboard at the Nasdaq stock market is showing information about Arm Holdings’ initial public offering today: Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA 3h ago 17.07 BST Rene Haas (centre), the CEO of ARM Holdings, with his corporate leadership team at the Nasdaq stock market today Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA 3h ago 16.55 BST Arm Holdings $ARM is currently indicated to open trading today at $57 above its IPO price of $51 — Evan (@StockMKTNewz) September 14, 2023 3h ago 16.41 BST FTSE 100 jumps 1.95%, best day of 2023 Newsflash: The UK’s blue-chip stock index has just posted its best day of the year so far.

The rally was led by mining companies such as Anglo American (+7.7%), Rio Tinto (+4.7%) and Glencore (+4.3%).

"After days of heavy rain and flash flooding in New England, Hurricane Lee is up next","Days of wild weather that produced torrential rain, flooding, sinkholes and a tornado in New England could be a prelude to something more dangerous lurking offshore — Hurricane Lee. As the Category 1 system swirled southwest of Bermuda, Maine Gov. Janet Mills declared a state of emergency on Thursday, and the state was under its first hurricane watch in 15 years. The water-logged region prepared for 20-foot (6-meter) waves and wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph), along with more rain. A dangerous storm surge was projected for Friday evening for Massachusetts’ Cape Cod Bay and Nantucket Island, while the brunt of the storm was to arrive early Saturday. Although Lee did not contribute to the recent flooding, it threatened to exacerbate conditions in a region that is already much too wet. The Coast Guard and emergency management agencies warned New England residents to be prepared, and utility companies brought in reinforcements to deal with power outages. At Boothbay Harbor Marina in Maine, the community came together to remove boats from the water to keep them out of harm's way. “It’s a batten-down-the-hatches kind of day,” owner Kim Gillies said Thursday. Similar scenes played out at Kennebunkport Marina, where crews planned to take 100 boats out of the water, said Cathy Norton, marina manager. Commercial lobster fisherman Steve Train said fishermen have been sinking gear in deeper water to protect against storm damage. Fishing boats were also headed to the safety of harbors. In Canada, where the remnants of Hurricane Fiona a year ago washed houses into the ocean, knocked out power to most of two provinces and swept a 72-year-old woman into the sea, residents of western Nova Scotia and southern New Brunswick were warned to prepare for power outages and flooding this weekend. New Brunswick Minister of Public Safety Kris Austin urged residents to assemble a 72-hour safety kit that included batteries, water, food, medication and a radio. In her emergency declaration on Thursday, the governor urged people to take the storm seriously and to make preparations. Mills, a Democrat, also asked President Joe Biden to issue a preemptive presidential disaster declaration to give the state access to federal resources. Earlier in the week, the region saw 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain over six hours. Tornado warnings were posted Wednesday for communities in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and more heavy rain opened up sinkholes and brought devastating flooding to several areas. The National Weather Service in Boston confirmed Thursday that damage to trees and power lines in Rhode Island and Connecticut the day before was consistent with a tornado. In Lincoln, Rhode Island, photos taken after the storm showed that at least one roof was damaged, and the press box at the high school stadium tipped into the bleachers. At midday Thursday, Lee was spinning 245 miles (395 kilometers) southwest of Bermuda, with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. It was traveling north on a path that could lead to landfall in Nova Scotia, possibly as a tropical storm, forecasters said. The system threatened to bring a mixed bag of threats. Ocean waves as tall as 20 feet could lash the coast, damaging structures and causing erosion; powerful wind gusts could knock down trees weakened by a wet summer; and rain could cause flash flooding in a region where the soil is already saturated, said Louise Fode, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Maine. The State's eastern coast — known as the Down East region — and the coast of Nova Scotia was expected to bear the brunt of the storm, though the track could shift before the system arrives, Fode said. One thing working in the region's favor: The storm surge will not be accompanied by an astronomical high tide, helping to lower the risk, she said. New England has experienced its share of flooding this summer, including a storm that dumped up to two months of rain in two days in Vermont in July, resulting in two deaths. Scientists are finding that storms around the world are forming in a warmer atmosphere, making extreme rainfall more frequent. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey issued a state of emergency late Tuesday following “catastrophic flash flooding and property damage” in two counties and other communities. The torrential downpour in a six-hour period was a “200-year event,” said Matthew Belk, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boston. The State is monitoring the conditions of dams, the governor said, and she urged residents to stay off the roads when ordered. The rain created several sinkholes in Leominster, Massachusetts, including one at a car dealership where several vehicles were swallowed up. In Providence, Rhode Island, downpours flooded a parking lot and parts of a shopping mall. Firefighters used inflatable boats to rescue more than two dozen people stranded in cars. Looking ahead, the hurricane watch for Maine extended from Stonington to the Canadian border. The last time a hurricane watch was declared in Maine was in 2008, for Hurricane Kyle. Meanwhile, a tropical storm watch was in effect from Stonington south to Watch Hill, Rhode Island. That includes Block Island, Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket. In Maine, residents often boast about being accustomed to rough weather. Lee's projected wind, rain and surf are akin to a powerful Nor'easter, and people are familiar with those.

Sanjay reflects on Jawan and Gadar 2 BO success,"The massive success of Sunny Deol starrer Gadar 2 and Shah Rukh Khan's Jawan has made everyone believe that the audiences are back in theatres. But director Sanjay Gupta feels that until the mid-budget or small-budget films do well, we can't say that the audiences are back in theatres. The massive success of starrer Gadar 2 and 's Jawan has made everyone believe that the audiences are back in theatres. But director Sanjay Gupta feels that until the mid-budget or small-budget films do well, we can't say that the audiences are back in theatres. ""Gadar 2 and Jawan are big-budget films and they have taken 2-3 years to be made. Theatres will be empty again after a couple of weeks, waiting for the next big film to arrive. All the big stars do one film a year. No big star does two films. did not have a release in the last five years. Hrithik and Aamir also do one film in two years. It can’t be the case that only these top 5-6 stars’ films work. When people go to the theatres to back a combination of films then I’d say that the audiences are back,"" Sanjay told ETimes. Like there’s a film called Baap coming up starring Mithun Chakraborty, Sanjay Dutt, Sunny Deol and Jackie Shroff. When people go to watch that film then I can say that the audiences are really coming back to theatres. Earlier, we wouldn’t call a film that has done 90 cr business a hit. Nowadays, we call a film superhit if it has done a 75 cr business. We start congratulating each other if the film gets an opening of 4-5 cr. The fault lies with us makers too. I’d say that we have been orphaned. And I’ll explain how. Humare upar koi Maai-Baap nahin hai. Earlier, at least a studio was there that would pump up the PNA. Now, who does the marketing for a small-budget film? Studios have shut down. There’s no studio green-lighting a film, literally. It is becoming a Catch-22. Films neither films are made nor audiences are coming. Once these two things return to normalcy. The Film City used to have more than 50 shoots a day on average. Today, there are hardly 5-6 shoots happening a day. All the stars are sitting at home. Producers ke offices mein maatam hai yaar. Absolutely not. What are we celebrating? This money is not coming into the film industry, no? It is going back to those who invested. How does it change anything for the film industry? The exhibitors who were suffering have got some relief. They’re happy for a while but in their hearts, they also know, “Yeh chaar din ki chaandni hai.” It’s not just action. There’s Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani too. A good, well-promoted, entertaining film with a big star – people are coming. But if the film is not big or doesn’t have big names, people are ready to watch it on OTT. As it is Indians like free ka maal. We pay for OTT subscriptions, but in a sense these things are free only. 95% of the movies are skipped by the general audience in theatres. They prefer to watch it at home. Right now, we are talking about only spectacles and brand value. A spectacle of Pathaan and Jawan or brand value of Gadar 2. But how many of such films can be released in a year? After watching Pathaan, I came out of the theatre as a worried man. I said, “As a filmmaker, this is the new normal. This means apart from the stars, I need 200 crores to compete with that film. To make a film, I will need two big stars, one villain and a massive heroine. You’ll need that in order to compete.” In Jawan, Shah Rukh has done the same. Knowing Shah Rukh and his passion for movies, he has worked with the same passion for Paheli as he has worked for Jawan. He works with passion and he spends money with passion. In Aap Ki Adalat, SRK said that, I don’t take money from films. I tell producers to spend on the film. I earn money from appearances and endorsements; which is so true. Have you ever heard that Shah Rukh Khan has charged this much money for a film? Baaki heroes ka statement bann jaata hai. This is common in south Indian cinema. Hats off to Atlee. and it is courageous of Shah Rukh to back that content. In the south, they take up issues. There’s masti, dhamaal, over the top moments in the film, but that one ungli wala speech balances everything. It’s very good.

"""When You Have Unusual Things..."": NASA On ""Alien Bodies"" Shown In Mexico","Mexican Congress recently held hearing on UFOs featuring purported 'alien' bodies The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on Thursday released a new report on what it calls the ""unidentified anomalous phenomenon"" (UAP), better known to the public as unidentified flying objects, or UFOs. In response to a recommendation by an independent study team for NASA to play a more prominent role in understanding UFOs , the US space agency announced that it is appointing a director of UAP research. During the press conference, NASA officials were also asked questions about the UFO hearing in Mexico's Congress that featured the presentation of alleged remains of non-human beings . David Spergel, the former head of Princeton University's astrophysics department and chair of the UAP report, said he did not know the nature of the samples but urged transparency. ""This is something that I have only seen on Twitter. When you have unusual things, you want to make the data public,"" Mr Spergel said. ""We don't know the nature of those samples,"" he said. ""If you have something strange, make samples available to the scientific community,"" he told the Mexican government. Mexican journalist and long-time UFO enthusiast Jaime Maussan showed politicians at the hearing on Tuesday two tiny ""bodies"" displayed in cases, with three fingers on each hand and elongated heads. He said in the presentation that the specimens were recovered near Peru's ancient Nazca Lines and had been carbon-dated by Mexico's National Autonomous University (UNAM) and concluded to be about 1,000 years old. Maussan claimed they were not related to any species on Earth.

"Watch: 6 Needed From 2, Sri Lanka Pull Of A Thriller Against Pakistan","One of the finest cricketing contests of the Asia Cup 2023 unfolded on Thrusday day as Sri Lanka edged Pakistan in a last-ball thriller to enter the final of the tournament. It was Sri Lanka's Kusal Mendis produced an outstanding 91 while Charith Asalanka gave him good company with a gutsy unbeaten 49 to set up the final against India. Pakistan looked to have done well to pull themsleves in the winning position after Shaheen Afridi's spectacular penultimate over. but, Sri Lanka reached the target of 252 runs, scoring 6 runs from the last 2 balls. Half-centuries from Abdullah Shafique (52) and Mohammad Rizwan (86 not out) had led Pakistan to a competitive 252 for 7 off 42 overs after electing to bat on another rain-affected day. But Sri Lanka replied in kind through Mendis and Asalanka as they inched past the target off the last ball of the match, also spoiling the possibility of an Indo-Pak summit clash. After Kusal Perera departed early, Mendis in the company of Pathum Nissanka (29) steadied the Lankan innings with a 57-run stand for the second wicket. But an even better passage was in the waiting for the Lankans, despite Nissanka spooning a return catch to Shadab Khan. Mendis and Sadeera Samarawickrama (48 off 51 balls) added 100 runs for the third wicket, as Lanka gradually bridged the gap. Mendis is blessed with natural striking prowess and timing, and his knock was a validation of that. The right-hander used his feet well against spinners, and faced the quicker lot with assurance. Samarawickrama, even though he was pinged on the helmet once by Shaheen Afridi, kept his end going with some sensible cricket. But a momentary rush ended his stay. Iftikhar caught him in no-man's land with a slightly fuller length ball, and Rizwan made an easy stumping. Advertisement Mendis milked a further 33 runs along with Asalanka, but Iftikhar returned to dismiss him. Mendis' effort to turn the ball off his pads resulted in a leading edge, which was caught superbly by a diving Mohamamd Harris. Thereafter Sri Lanka fell into panic mode, losing four wickets in as many overs and it seemed that they were on the verge of botching up the chase. pic.twitter.com/sTYOFFQzml Afridi did the damage during that phase with two wickets in successive balls.

"Lymphoma Awareness Day 2023: The Difference Between Lymphoma And Leukaemia, Their Diagnoses And Treatment","By Dr Monisha Harimadhavan Leukaemia and lymphoma are two types of blood cancer. They originate in the tissues that produce blood and affect our blood and immune systems. However, they have different characteristics. Leukaemia mainly disrupts the bone marrow's normal function of producing blood cells and leads to an overproduction of abnormal white cells called blasts. Due to the presence of these abnormal cells in the bone marrow, the production of other normal cells like red blood cells and platelets is affected. Leukaemia has different forms, some progressing rapidly (acute) and others slowly (chronic). Both children and adults can be affected. Lymphoma, on the other hand, begins in the lymphatic system, a vital component of our immune system that contains white blood cells, called lymphocytes, responsible for transporting lymph that removes toxins, waste, and foreign substances. It primarily affects two types of white blood cells: B cells and T cells. The lymphatic system in our body includes the lymph nodes, thymus, spleen, and bone marrow. Lymphomas most commonly present as solid masses in the lymph nodes. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); Occasionally, they can also involve the bone marrow and lead to the underproduction of normal blood cells, like that seen in leukaemia or as an enlargement of the spleen. What are the different types of Lymphoma? Lymphoma can be categorised into two primary types: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is more common and can affect people of various ages. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is of two further types: B-cell and T-cell. Lymphoma In summary, leukaemia and lymphoma are both blood cancers, but they affect different parts of the body and have their own unique characteristics. While leukaemia and lymphoma share some general symptoms common to many cancers, such as fatigue, unexplained weight loss, and frequent infections, they also exhibit specific symptoms related to their origin, What are the symptoms of leukaemia? The symptoms of leukaemia include fatigue, frequent infections, easy bruising, bone pain, and enlarged spleen. Fatigue happens due to decreased red blood cells. Frequent infections can result from compromised white blood cells. Easy bruising and bleeding are caused by a shortage of platelets. Bone Pain occurs because leukaemia often affects the bone marrow. In some cases, there can be enlarged spleen, liver, or lymph nodes. What are the symptoms of lymphoma? The symptoms of lymphoma include swollen lymph nodes, fever and night sweats, unexplained weight loss, itchy skin, frequent infections, and enlarged spleen or liver, among others. Itchy skin is sometimes observed in the case of cutaneous lymphoma. Frequent infections occur due to immune system disruption. Occasionally, the spleen or liver may become enlarged. How is leukaemia diagnosed? Leukaemia diagnosis usually requires a bone marrow examination along with flow cytometry for confirmation, and for some types of leukaemias, genetic tests for certain mutations are imperative for risk stratification. How is lymphoma diagnosed? Lymphoma diagnosis is usually made by lymph node biopsy and examination, along with an additional test called immunohistochemistry (IHC), to determine the type of lymphoma. Staging is very important in lymphoma and is usually done by a whole-body scan called a PET scan. How are leukaemia and lymphoma treated? Treatment options for leukaemia and lymphoma depend on factors like the specific type and the patient's overall health. However, there are general approaches to both leukaemia and lymphoma. Treatment for leukaemia Acute leukaemias are generally aggressive and need immediate treatment. Chronic leukaemia often progresses slowly. The following are the different modalities that are currently available for the treatment of leukaemia. Chemotherapy: High-dose drugs to kill cancer cells Radiation therapy: Employs focused radiation to eradicate cancer cells. Stem cell transplant: The curative option used for only high-risk cases, replaces unhealthy bone marrow with healthy stem cells from a normal person. Targeted therapy: Medications that target specific abnormalities in cancer cells Immunotherapy: enhancing the immune system's ability to fight cancer Treatment for lymphoma The prognosis and treatment options for lymphoma vary depending on the type, stage, and response to treatment. Chemotherapy is commonly used to treat both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Radiation Therapy: To target specific lymph nodes Immunotherapy: It is particularly effective for some types of lymphoma. Targeted therapy: It involves drugs designed to address specific irregularities within cancer cells. Stem cell transplant: In select cases, such as relapsed or refractory lymphoma. In conclusion, leukaemia and lymphoma, though both blood cancers, are distinct in terms of their origin, symptoms, and treatment approaches. Leukaemia primarily affects the bone marrow and white blood cells, while lymphoma originates in the lymphatic system and targets B cells and T cells. Recognising these differences is crucial for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment planning, as early detection and tailored therapies can significantly improve outcomes for individuals facing these challenging conditions.

During periods of global economic downturns, investors often turn to gold as a safe haven, causing the price to rise.

Women's Bundesliga: What You Need to Know for 2023-24,"The Women's Bundesliga kicks off its 34th season hoping to latch on to the momentum of this summer's World Cup — despite Germany's early exit. The usual suspects are expected to remain dominant — at least for now.Who are the favorites?

As the defending Bundesliga champions, Bayern Munich are favorites to win it all again in 2023-24.

The headline acts are the 2018 and 2020 UEFA World Player of the Year, Pernille Harder (Chelsea, Denmark) and Magdalena Eriksson (Chelsea, Sweden). Bayern have further strengthened their side with goalkeepers Anna Wellmann (Turbine Potsdam), Erin Nayler (Norrköping, New Zealand), midfielder Sam Kerr (Rangers, Scotland) and defender Katharina Naschenweng (Hoffenheim, Austria). Runners-up, Wolfsburg, had won five of the previous six titles and promise to be contenders again. The Wolves, who won their ninth-consecutive German Cup last season, are led by national team captain and German Women's Player of the Year for 2023, Alexandra Popp. While they also dipped into the summer transfer market, with national team midfielder Chantal Hagel (Hoffenheim) being their biggest signing, they didn't come close to making the splash their Bavarian rivals did. Last season's Champions League finalists are banking on a squad that has essentially been left intact for 2023-24. Still dark horses but in the mix are Eintracht Frankfurt, who have enjoyed something of a renaissance in recent years, since 1. FFC Frankfurt, strictly a women's club and long one of the league's dominant sides, joined the men's Bundesliga club in 2020. Having finished third in the league last term, Eintracht recently raised eyebrows beyond Germany, beating Juventus in a penalty shootout in the Champions League qualifying playoffs. This leaves them just one step away from the UCL group stage. Who is new, who has departed? New to the Women's Bundesliga are RB Leipzig, who will be making their debut seven seasons after their men's team took the German men's topflight by storm in 2016. Though always controversial, RB Leipzig's men have never looked back, regularly qualifying for the Champions League and winning the last two German Cups. Whether Leipzig's women can do the same remains to be seen, but, like the men's team, they have no shortage of funds. This is far from the same team that dominated the second division last season, with eight new players having been brought in. A key signing is forward Sandra Starke who has 172 Bundesliga appearances to her name, with Freiburg and powerhouses Wolfsburg. Also new are Nuremberg, who won promotion to the topflight for the first time since 1999. Their approach is very much in contrast to Red Bull, with few players, including the new signings, having had much Bundesliga experience. However, they are expected to be competitive in their first season back in the Bundesliga and will be playing out of the men's venue, the 50,000-capacity Max-Morlock-Stadion. Gone from the Bundesliga for the next 12 months (at least) are SV Meppen and Turbine Potsdam, whose six championships are second only to the seven won by 1. FFC Frankfurt (now Eintracht Frankfurt) and Wolfsburg. What's new? One thing that is different is the name of the Women's Bundesliga — due to a change in sponsorship. No longer is the league known as the ""FLYERALARM Frauen-Bundesliga,"" now its moniker is the perhaps more internationally prestigious ""Google Pixel Frauen-Bundesliga."" It's a change that DFB (German FA) Managing Director Holger Blask hopes will ""further strengthen the visibility and attractiveness of the Women's Bundesliga."" What may be more controversial among fans, particularly the traditionalists among them, is the fact that Monday night games are being introduced for 2023-24. One game per matchday is to kick off between 6 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. on Mondays. We're only two seasons on from the abolition of Monday games from the men's Bundesliga — following repeated protests by organized fans. How supporters of the women's game will take to the change is an open question. Monday games could also pose a considerable inconvenience for many players, who, unlike their male counterparts, still need to hold down a day job to make ends meet. When does it start? The new season opens with Bayern Munich away to Freiburg on Friday — with the rest of the matches spread over Saturday and Sunday.

"Real Madrid Youth Players Arrested Over Alleged Circulation of Sexual Video Featuring Minor, Club Issues Statement","Madrid, Sep 15: Spanish police have arrested four unnamed Real Madrid youth players for allegedly sharing a sexual video on WhatsApp, featuring a minor girl. The players, who are of legal age between 20 and 21 years old, were arrested at the club's training complex on Thursday. They were released hours later after giving statements at police headquarters, El Confidencial newspaper reported. The arrest was made after the minor's mother reported the events in Mogan (Gran Canaria), since according to her daughter's version, she did not authorise that recording to be leaked. According to what is being investigated, these players distributed that video on WhatsApp, El Confidencial and Cadena SER radio station reported. Spanish Judge Francisco De Jorge Summons Luis Rubiales for Investigation Regarding His Kiss Controversy With Jenni Hermoso at FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023. Neither the recording nor the broadcast was consented to by the minor. Three of the arrested players are from Real Madrid's C team, with a fourth coming from the club's B team, known as Castilla. The Cadena SER report, citing sources close to Real Madrid, also claimed that the girl maintained a consensual relationship and recording took place in June without her consent, which is why they are accused of spreading the video to third parties. Following the news of the arrest, Real Madrid issued a statement in which it clarified that a total of 4 players were involved. ""Real Madrid wishes to announce that it has learned that a Castilla player and three Real Madrid C players have made statements to the Civil Guard in relation to a complaint about the alleged broadcasting of a private video via WhatsApp.When the club has detailed knowledge of the facts, we will take the appropriate measures,"" it said in a statement.

Spain's Minister of Equality, Irene Montero, reacted on the matter and said that spreading sexual images is a violence: ""Spreading sexual images without consent is also sexual violence and this is recognized by the Law ""Only yes means yes. Spain has said #It'sAcabo : we have an obligation not to look the other way and guarantee all rights to all women. All my support to the victim and her family,"" she wrote on X.

Rain has led to several matches being affected, the most memorable of them being the India vs Pakistan contest in the group stage on September 2, which got called off. The Super Four matches at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo also have had its fair share of interruptions.

As per Accuweather, the weather will be cloudy when this match gets underway but unfortunately, rain and thunderstorm is likely to follow later in the evening. Thus there remains the chance of this match being a rain-curtailed one. It has to be remembered that although this match is nothing but a dead rubber, there is no reserve day and hence, India and Bangladesh will get a point apiece if there's a washout. A lot would also depend on the ground staff at this stadium, who have been nothing but phenomenal all this time, working hard to cover the pitch on time in case there's rain and also doing their best at drying the pitch to prepare it for the game. India for the record, have reached the final already where they will take on Sri Lanka, who beat Pakistan in a nail-biting contest on September 14. Bangladesh on the other hand, are winless in the Super Four stage and would want to change that as they look to sign off from the tournament on a high.",sports
"Adani Power, Zomato, Tata Power, IOC, IRCTC among top 20 largecap stocks bought &amp; sold by mutual funds in August","The Indian stock market indices are trading at record high levels with the benchmark Nifty scaling above 20,000-mark. The rally in domestic equity markets has been fuelled by a combination of strong domestic macroeconomic data and positive global cues. The Nifty50 index is up more than 11% in 2023 so far, but the midcap and smallcap indices have outperformed the frontline indices by a big margin. Strong domestic GDP growth, moderating inflation, narrowing Current Account Deficit (CAD) and global interest rates nearing its peak are some macro factors driving the rally. Moreover, robust corporate earnings growth and expectations of high-teens earnings CAGR over FY23-25E have also kept the market sentiment buoyant, analysts said. Meanwhile, equity mutual funds saw a significant surge in net inflows, reaching a five-month high of 20,245.26 crore in August 2023. However, large-cap equity funds saw outflows of 348 crore. Adani Power, Zomato, Indian Railway Catering And Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) and Tata Power Company were among the largecap stocks that mutual funds bought the most in the month of August.

Rohan Bopanna Gets Ready For Davis Cup Farewell As India Take On Morocco,"Hauling itself up from World Group II should not be a complicated task for India when it takes on an unostentatious Morocco in the home tie, which will be more of a celebration of Rohan Bopanna's Davis Cup career, which will come to a halt after 21 years on Sunday. Lack of singles players who could challenge the big boys of the ATP circuit, coupled with defeats in winnable matches, has hurt the Indian Davis Cup team badly in the last few years in this team tournament, but relegation to World Group II was a new low the Indian team hit in February. It was for the first time since the new format was launched in 2019 that the Indians dropped to this level. Much has changed since India last played in the Davis Cup tie in March, when it lost 2-3 to Denmark. Indian tennis has hardly had any memorable moments this season until Bopanna reached the US Open final last week. It's not just the lack of on-court results in singles; off-court, the country also felt the disappointment of losing its only ATP 250 event. Yuki Bhambri, one of the finest players India has seen, has stopped playing the singles format. Ramkumar Ramanathan has dropped out of even the top-550 and is languishing at number 570. Such has been his plight this season that the Chennai player has made 17 first-round exits at different tournaments, including the lowest rung, the ITF Futures level. It's not surprising that skipper Rohit Rajpal has not included Ramkumar in the lineup, though he remains a part of the squad to help train the players. But Bopanna is still playing some solid tennis in the doubles format. At 43, he still is one of the most powerful servers on the circuit. His strokes still have sting, and he can still pull off those stunning passing winners from difficult angles or while running on flanks. Advertisement It would have been ideal if he had got his farewell tie where he wanted -- in Bengaluru -- but he still has a chance to bid adieu to the Davis Cup before the home fans. In 32 ties played since making his debut in 2002, the player from Coorg has won 22 matches, including 10 singles. He will team up with Yuki for one final time in Davis Cup, even as he continues to play on the ATP circuit. Ranked inside the top-10, he has no reason to hang up his racquet. The AITA felicitated Bopanna in a special event on Thursday night, where his contribution to Indian tennis was lauded. Bopanna will have a lot of friends and family members in the stands, which can accommodate about 1,300 people. Ideally, as Bopanna had requested, his farewell tie should have been hosted in Benglauru, which has much better infrastructure and can accommodate 6,500 spectators. India's number one singles player, Sumit Nagal, is in good form. He is entering the tie after playing the final of a Challenger event in Austria. It was his third final of the season at that level. Unless there is an inexplicable meltdown, he would win two points for India. Sasi Mukund will finally get to make his debut. He was named in the team even for the tie against Pakistan back in 2019 but pulled out, saying he had suffered a foot injury. Digvijay Pratap Singh has also made the cut, and he might get to play a dead rubber. Hot and humid conditions will pose a serious fitness test for both teams. Though the timings have been revised and the start of the matches has been delayed by two hours, it will still be a tough task to negate the energy-sapping conditions. Morocco has only one worthy challenger for India's singles players, Elliot Benchetrit. The 24-year-old 6'4"" tall player might be ranked just 465 on the ATP singles chart as of today, but he touched a career-high 198 in February 2020. Benchetrit has cherished wins against top-100 players, including one against a top-50 player, and has competed at the biggest stage -- the Grand Slams -- too. Out of the two Indian singles players, Mukund has played and beaten him. They clashed in January 2022 at the Forli Challenger, where the Indian emerged victorious in two sets. If at all there will be some fight, it will be against Benchetrit, who qualified for the US Open in 2019 and Australian Open in 2020, beating quality players such as Emil Ruusuvuori of Finland on the way. He had entered the French Open as a wild card in 2018 and took a set off Frenchman Gael Monfils before losing the opening round. The visiting team's second singles player is 20-year-old Yassine Dlimi, ranked 557. He is still plying his trade on the ITF Futures circuit. Adam Moundir is further behind at 779, and the remaining two players -- Walid Ahouda and Younes Lalami Laaroussi -- do not figure even in the top-1000. Given the weak opponents, winning this tie won't be much of a challenge for India but chalking out a roadmap for the future will be. Captain Rajpal and AITA officials need to sit and discuss what is wrong with the system that India does not have a single top-100 singles player, and the team is now fighting it out in World Group II. There are a lot of questions that need answers and some serious soul searching. Unless India have quality singles players, the country will not excel either in Davis Cup or Grand Slams. Tennis remains an individual and professional sport but it's time that AITA comes up with something special to save the game from plunging to new lows.",sports

NIIT share price surges about 56% in September so far; should you buy? Here's what experts say,"The performance of NIIT's share price in September has been nothing short of astonishing, with a remarkable surge of 56 per cent while equity benchmark Sensex has gained about 5 per cent in September so far. On a monthly scale, the stock is in the green after three consecutive months of losses. In June this year, the stock cracked nearly 79 per cent, followed by modest declines of 2 per cent each in both July and August. This stock has been extremely volatile over the last year. Over the past three months, the stock has demonstrated a remarkable surge, registering a gain of 44 per cent. However, when assessing its performance over a slightly longer horizon of six months, the stock reveals a starkly different trend, with a notable decline of over 64 per cent during that period. On Friday, the stock plunged 5 per cent on BSE. In the previous session on Thursday, the stock ended with a loss of 6.62 per cent. Mint talked to fundamental and technical experts to understand what is the road ahead for the stock and what should investors do with it. Here's what they said. Fundamental views Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth, Swastika Investmart NIIT Ltd., an ed-tech company, has recently experienced a price surge in the market. The stock performance is a reflection of the company's recent demerger, innovative expansion, introduction of fresh business models, and engagement of students in exciting new training and enrollment approaches for NIIT courses. NIIT acquired the remaining 10 per cent stake in RPS Consulting, making it a fully owned subsidiary of NIIT. Management has provided guidance that the company is emerging from a negative growth cycle, with expectations of sustained growth throughout the year. Dhruv Mudaraddi, Research Analyst, StoxBox NIIT shares have seen a sharp run-up in the last few days after the Chairman and Founder, Rajendra Singh Pawar, reiterated the future prospects and plans of the company to expand into new sectors (focused on AI) where India will seek large-scale talent in the near future. The company has also set an ambitious target revenue of 1,200 crore by FY27-28. The confidence stems from the belief that the IT sector which is poised to grow strongly has its focus on reskilling as a critical priority and NIIT is well-positioned to absorb the benefits and expand its business into emerging sectors through organic as well as inorganic growth. The company has cash reserves of 700 crore, which it has earmarked for potential . However, at the current price levels, the analyst believes that it would be prudent to be on the sidelines as most of the positives are already priced in and one should await execution from the company side and keep a close eye on the IT sector hiring trends for making a further investment decision. CA Vatsal Vinchhi, Equity Analyst - IT sector, Choice Equity Broking NIIT underwent a demerger from NLSL last quarter.

Global Economy to Weaken in Coming Year but Economists Confident of India Growth: WEF Study,"Most economists expect the global economy to weaken in the coming year amid political and financial volatility, but a large majority of over 90 per cent are confident of moderate or strong growth in South Asia, notably India, a survey showed on Friday. At the same time, the outlook for China has dimmed following signs of deflationary pressures and fragility in the country’s real estate market, the World Economic Forum’s latest ‘Chief Economists Outlook’ report said. As the world grapples with political and financial volatility, almost six in 10 believe the global economic outlook will undermine progress towards meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with 74 per cent saying geopolitical tensions will have the same effect. As world leaders head to New York for the UN high-level week to discuss how to advance on the SDGs, the WEF report found that over 60 per cent of chief economists expect the global economy to weaken in the coming year amid uncertain domestic and international politics and unsettled financial markets. Although a large majority (86 per cent) expects the recent global inflationary surge to ease, the prolonged tightening of financial conditions is expected to have lasting impacts, including a squeeze on business lending, increases in corporate debt defaults, and potential corrections in property and equity markets. Developing countries face the most acute effects of these global headwinds, with chief economists warning that progress towards global development goals could be undermined by geopolitical tensions (74 per cent) and tighter financial conditions (59 per cent), the WEF said. “This is particularly concerning with slowing progress in many areas of the SDGs, including food security, climate action and biodiversity protection. At the current pace, more than half a billion people will still live in extreme poverty in 2030,"" it added. A minority of chief economists expect increased cooperation (41 per cent) and private capital flows (30 per cent) between advanced and developing countries over the next three years. However, if flows of private capital can be unlocked, the economists are particularly optimistic about the potential positive impact on specific areas of development: digital transformation (97 per cent), energy access and affordability (76 per cent), food systems and nutrition (67 per cent), and climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution (67 per cent). “The latest Chief Economists Outlook points to continuing weakness in the global economy,"" WEF Managing Director Saadia Zahidi said. “It also highlights the urgent challenges and trade-offs being faced by developing countries, and the need for innovation, cross-border investment and technology transfer to make growth, climate action and human development compatible,"" she added. The economic outlook varies across regions for 2023-2024. “While the chief economists are most optimistic about growth in Asia, the outlook for China has dimmed since the (last) May 2023 survey, following signs of deflationary pressures and fragility in the country’s real estate market. “Over 90 per cent expect moderate or strong growth this year in South Asia, notably India, with a clear increase since the last survey in the share of respondents expecting strong growth in the region, from 36 per cent to 52 per cent,"" the WEF said. In the US, the outlook has strengthened since May, with eight in 10 respondents now expecting moderate or strong growth in both 2023 and 2024. In Europe, 77 per cent expect weak or very weak growth this year, but there is growing optimism about 2024, with expectations of moderate or strong growth jumping from 23 per cent to 60 per cent. The Chief Economist Outlook builds on the latest policy development research as well as consultations and surveys with leading chief economists from the public and private sectors, organized by the WEF’s Centre for the New Economy and Society.",business
"Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom Trailer Breakdown: From Timeline To Lore, Every Plot Detail Revealed","DC just dropped the trailer for awaited sequel titled .

Anurag Kashyap Still Feels Guilty About Dropping Ranveer Singh From Bombay Velvet: 'Reached Out To Him But..',"Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap, known for his bold and distinctive films, recently opened up about one of the regrets that has lingered in his career—the casting change in his 2015 film . Kashyap revealed that actor Ranveer Singh was enthusiastic about the project and had even memorized all the dialogues for the film. However, due to budgetary constraints, the director had to replace Ranveer with Ranbir Kapoor for the lead role. In a candid interview with Bollywood Bubble, Anurag Kashyap shared insights into the casting decisions behind . He disclosed that Ranveer Singh was genuinely eager to be part of the film and had gone to great lengths to prepare for his role, committing himself to memorizing all the dialogues. The film initially had a more modest budget, but as the project progressed, it was sold at a substantially higher cost, making it financially unsustainable for the filmmakers. Anurag Kashyap was not directly involved in the selling of the film and expressed his inability to sustain the escalating budget. As a result, he decided to replace Ranveer Singh with Ranbir Kapoor, and the film was ultimately made with the latter as the lead. He said, ""I tried very hard. I tried so hard that I even postponed the shoot of Bombay Velvet and shot Ugly, hoping things will get right in that time because Ranveer also, at that time, started doing Lootera. So I waited."" Ranveer Singh had previously spoken about his departure from on Karan Johar's talk show, . He explained that at the time, his star power did not justify the film's budget, leading to his ""unceremonious"" exit from the project. Ranveer acknowledged that the landscape of the film industry has since changed, with his star value on the rise. Reflecting on the casting decision and its impact, Anurag Kashyap admitted that it would have been nearly impossible to proceed with the film if he had retained Ranveer Singh. Anurag spoke about why he hasn't collaborated with Ranveer yet and said, ""I have tried to but I also have my own guilt. I feel like I should have cut down my cost but I didn’t understand a lot of things back then, now I get that."" He further appreciated Ranveer's latest cinematic offering and said, ""There was a time when I reached out to him but he was dealing with his own issues and I was in a desperate phase so I said, ‘you deal with your things, I’ll move on’ but I keep in touch with him. He killed it in Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani so I complimented him.""",entertainment

"Oatmeal Soothes Your Skin. Know Its Benefits, Applications, And Remedies For Allergic Reactions","(By Dr. Vichitra Sharma, who is a Consultant, Department of Dermatology at Amrita Hospital Faridabad) Oats are a type of cereal grain that is commonly grown and consumed around the world. They belong to the plant species Avena sativa. From culinary delights to skincare wonders, the versatile oat takes center stage in various aspects of our lives. Let us unravel the mysteries of oatmeal, exploring its culinary versatility and its remarkable potential for nurturing our skin. Driven by its natural properties and soothing qualities, oatmeal proves to be a powerful ally against allergic reactions, offering relief from the discomfort of itching, redness, and inflammation. Oats are primarily grown for their seeds, which are processed and used in various food products. Culinary Uses: Oats are a versatile ingredient used in a variety of dishes, with oatmeal being one of the most popular. Oatmeal can be served sweet or savoury, and oats are also used in baking, such as oatmeal cookies, granola bars, and oatcakes. Oats can be used as a thickening agent in soups and stews or as a coating for fried foods. Health Benefits: Oats are considered a healthy food choice due to their high fibre content, which can help promote digestive health and may contribute to lower cholesterol levels. The beta-glucans in oats are known to have potential cardiovascular benefits. Oats are also a good source of energy and can help keep you feeling full and satisfied. What Are The Benefits Of Oatmeal For The Skin? Oatmeal can offer several benefits for the skin when used in skincare routines and products. These benefits are primarily attributed to its natural properties and soothing qualities. Here are some of the advantages of using oatmeal for skin: googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); Soothes Irritated Skin: Oatmeal has anti-inflammatory properties that can help soothe and calm irritated or inflamed skin. It is often used to alleviate the discomfort associated with conditions like eczema, psoriasis, sunburn, and insect bites. Moisturizes Dry Skin: Oatmeal contains beta-glucans, which form a protective layer on the skin's surface, helping to lock in moisture. This can be particularly beneficial for individuals with dry or sensitive skin, providing hydration and relief from dryness and itchiness. Exfoliates Gently: Finely ground oatmeal can be used as a gentle exfoliant. It helps remove dead skin cells and unclog pores, leaving the skin smoother and softer without causing excessive irritation or damage. Balances Oil Production: Oatmeal can help regulate the skin's oil production, making it suitable for people with oily or acne-prone skin. It can cleanse the skin without stripping it of essential moisture, reducing the likelihood of excessive oil production. Reduces Redness: Oatmeal's anti-inflammatory properties can reduce redness and blotchiness in the skin. This makes it an excellent ingredient for soothing rosacea-prone or sensitive skin. Anti-Ageing Benefits: Oats are rich in antioxidants, such as vitamin E, which can help combat free radicals that contribute to premature ageing. Regular use of oat-based skincare products may help improve the overall appearance and texture of the skin. Natural Cleanser: Oatmeal can act as a natural cleanser, gently removing dirt, impurities, and excess oil from the skin's surface. This can be particularly useful for those with sensitive skin who may be prone to reactions from harsher cleansers. Reduces Itchiness: Oatmeal baths or oat-based skincare products are often recommended to alleviate itching caused by conditions like chickenpox, poison ivy, or allergic reactions. To harness these benefits for your skin, you can use oatmeal in various ways: Oatmeal Bath: Adding colloidal oatmeal (finely ground oatmeal) to your bathwater can help soothe and moisturise the skin. Oatmeal Face Masks: Create a homemade face mask by mixing oatmeal with water, yoghurt, honey, or other natural ingredients. Apply it to your face, leave it on for a short period, and then rinse off. Oatmeal-based Skincare Products: Look for skincare products that contain oatmeal as an ingredient, such as oatmeal-based creams, lotions, and soaps. Before trying any new skincare regimen or product, especially if you have sensitive or allergy-prone skin, it's a good idea to perform a patch test to ensure you don't have any adverse reactions. If you have specific skin concerns or conditions, consider consulting a dermatologist for personalised skincare recommendations. Oatmeal For Allergic Reactions: Oatmeal can be used in various ways to help alleviate symptoms of allergic reactions, particularly those affecting the skin. It's important to note that while oatmeal can provide relief for many people, individuals with severe allergies should consult a healthcare professional for appropriate treatment. Here are five ways oatmeal can be used for allergic reactions: Oatmeal Bath: Fill a bathtub with lukewarm water. Place a muslin bag or a clean sock filled with finely ground colloidal oatmeal (available in stores) under the running water to create an oatmeal-infused bath. Sit in the bath for 15-20 minutes to let your body soak the oatmeal. Gently pat your skin dry with a soft towel; do not rub. This method can help soothe itching, redness, and inflammation associated with allergic reactions such as hives or skin rashes. Oatmeal Paste: Mix finely ground oatmeal with water to create a thick paste. Apply the paste directly to the affected area of the skin. Let it stay for 15-20 minutes. Rinse it off with cool water. This can help reduce itching and inflammation from localized allergic reactions like insect bites or contact dermatitis. Oatmeal Face Mask: Combine finely ground oatmeal with yoghurt, honey, or aloe vera gel to create a soothing face mask. Gently apply the face mask while avoiding the areas around your eyes. Leave it on for 15-20 minutes. Rinse it off with lukewarm water. This can be beneficial for calming facial skin affected by allergic reactions or redness. Oatmeal Compress: Make a strong oatmeal infusion by steeping oatmeal in hot water, and then straining the liquid. Let it sit until the mixture is at room temperature. Soak a clean cloth or cotton pad in the oatmeal infusion. Gently apply the soaked cloth to the affected area for 10-15 minutes. This method can help reduce itching and inflammation for localized allergic reactions. Oatmeal-Based Skincare Products: Consider using over-the-counter skincare products that contain colloidal oatmeal as one of their ingredients. Look for creams, lotions, or ointments specifically formulated for soothing allergic skin reactions. Follow the product's instructions for application. Risk For Using Oatmeal In Allergies: Remember that oatmeal is generally safe for most people, but it's essential to ensure you are not allergic to oatmeal itself before using it for allergic reactions. If you experience severe or widespread allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis, difficulty breathing, or swelling of the face and throat, seek immediate medical attention and do not rely solely on oatmeal remedies. Always consult a healthcare professional if you have concerns about allergies or allergic reactions. Natural Ways To Treat Allergic Reactions: Treating allergic skin reactions naturally can provide relief from itching, redness, and inflammation without the use of synthetic or potentially harsh chemicals. Here are some natural ways to address allergic skin reactions: Cool Compress: Apply a cool, damp cloth or compress to the affected area. This can help reduce itching and soothe the skin. Avoid using hot water as it can worsen inflammation. Oatmeal Bath: As mentioned earlier, an oatmeal bath can be very soothing. Place colloidal oatmeal (finely ground oatmeal) in a muslin bag or sock and add it to a warm bath. Soak for 15-20 minutes to calm the skin. Aloe Vera: Apply pure aloe vera gel directly to the affected area. Aloe vera has anti-inflammatory and soothing properties that can help alleviate itching and redness. Coconut Oil: Apply organic, virgin coconut oil to the irritated skin. It has moisturizing and anti-inflammatory properties that can help relieve discomfort. Calendula Cream: Calendula is an herbal remedy known for its skin-soothing properties. You can find calendula creams or ointments at health food stores or make your own by infusing dried calendula flowers in any carrier oil and then using the oil on the affected area. Honey: Raw honey has natural antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Apply a thin layer of honey to the irritated skin and leave it on for about 20 minutes before Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water to keep your skin hydrated inside out. Skin remains healthy when the body is well hydrated. Avoid Triggers: Identify and avoid the allergens or triggers that cause your skin reactions. This may involve changing laundry detergents, avoiding certain foods, or using natural cleaning products. Remember that one size does not fit all – each person’s reaction to natural remedies may vary. If your allergic skin reaction is severe, persistent, or spreading, or if you experience symptoms like difficulty breathing or swelling of the face and throat, seek medical attention immediately. Additionally, if you have known allergies, consult with a dermatologist or allergist for personalized advice and treatment options.

"Jawed Habib: Clinical salons, with a doctor on board, are the future","The day is not far when we walk into a salon and alongside getting a haircut and styling, also meet a certified dermatologist or a trichologist to address our hair concerns, says Jawed Habib. “I believe in a science-based approach and what better than to address hair concerns from a doctor’s point of view? Clinical salons are the future,” he says over the phone when we speak in the context of his new book Beautiful Hair, Beautiful You . Jawed reveals that he is currently testing the idea of working alongside a dermatologist. “I began my career 35 years ago as a third-generation hairdresser and I’ve observed several changes. Earlier, there were beauty parlours. Today, hair salons are an exclusive business while makeup and nail art have their own spaces.” Beautiful Hair, Beautiful You! is his eighth book and is divided into three segments — finding the right look for different genders according to age and occasion; maintaining and improving hair health, and addressing myths and truths of hair care and styling. Ask him about addressing these aspects through a guidebook in the age of information overdose on social media and he says, “Everywhere I travel and meet people, they ask me about hair care. Every person I meet becomes a case study. Even when there is so much available on social media, people have hair issues. This book has simple and effective solutions that I have learnt throughout my journey.” The questions he gets asked frequently and the general lack of awareness, he says, prompted him to write the book. He mentions some of the common questions — is it good to wash your hair daily? (“Why not? It is essential to keep it clean. If we wash our face daily, why not the scalp?”), is trimming important? (“We are in the process of growing hair, how can someone grow healthy hair without trimming the ends; this step is very important.”), are colours bad for the hair? (“Colours are not bad, it is the wrong application that spoils hair.”) and so on. Jawed asserts that there is a strong connection between hair and self-confidence and does not advocate copying the hairstyles of politicians, movie, or sports stars. “What works for them may not work for you. Your style should suit your hair texture and your personality. Everyone has different hair and lifestyles. A good style is decided after examining the hair, its condition and the person’s lifestyle.” He spells out a few simple guidelines: “If you have curly hair, go for layers. If you have straight hair, go for straight cuts without layers. Bangs look good on people with sharp noses. Bangs and bobs require extra effort in styling, so one should keep in mind the person’s lifestyle.” With his salons operating in 120 cities across India and his hair academy claiming to have trained over 10 million students, he says is now at a stage where he prioritises hair education. “Ours has grown into a skill-based company and we train 99% of the staff who work in our salons. We want to grow everywhere, as a company.” In the past, he has authored books on hair yoga, hair colour, professional styling and the attitude required to build a business. “All the books I have written are from my experiences. I have cut and styled hair madly, I have opened salons madly, I have done seminars madly. So these books are about what I have genuinely felt and done in life.” Published by Jaico Books, Beautiful Hair, Beautiful You is priced at ? 359 and available on Amazon.in and bookstores across the country.",entertainment
Asia Cup 2023: Why Pakistan lost to Sri Lanka even when both teams scored 252. Explained,"Sri Lanka stunned the Pakistan cricket team by defeating them by 2 wickets which cleared the way for the elimination of Pakistan and defending champions Sri Lanka find themselves once again in the Asia Cup finals. The rain disrupted the match was a thriller with no clarity on where the game may go till the last ball. But, one confusion remained on everyone's mind about why Sri Lanka was declared as a winner even as they made the same runs as Pakistan. The fans kept wondering why one run was reduced from total score of 252, which became the winning target for Sri Lanka. Here's why Sri Lanka won even after scoring the same runs as Pakistan The logic lies in the rain disruption. As the rains delayed the beginning of the Pakistan vs Sri Lanka match, the game was reduced to 45 overs. Both teams started playing with the changed conditions but the rains again came pouring in during the first innings in which Pakistan was batting. The rains pushed the game more which was now reduced to 42 overs and after the innings, Pakistan scored a total of 252 runs. But, one run from Pakistan's total run was deducted as Duckworth-Lewis (DLS) calculations came into play. As before the second rain delay, as per the rules one run would have to be deducted from the total score. In case the 5th wicket did not fall, the score would be increased up to 255. DLS calculations undergo real-time adjustments throughout the game, taking into account the reduction in overs or the fall of wickets. Consequently, the target score is subject to fluctuations influenced by these variables. The calculation relies on a predetermined set of tables containing data about benchmark scores, available resources, and target scores, all of which are meticulously precomputed to ensure equitable and precise adjustments to the targets.",sports
The scariest horror movies on Shudder to keep you up at night,"Horror movies come in all shapes and sizes. You've got your comedy horrors , your psychological horrors, your tense thriller-y horrors — and, of course, your genuinely scary horrors. I'm not just talking about your run-of-the-mill, yikes-that's-a-bit-creepy kind of films, here, either. I'm talking about the truly terror-inducing — the type of movies you wake in the dead of night thinking about, and which stay with you for a long, long time after the credits have rolled. The horribly twitchy, sleep-with-the-lights-on-and-avoid-all-mirrors kind of movies. Streaming platform Shudder has a lot to offer in this regard. We've combed through the archives of the service (which is chock-full of horror, sci-fi and thrillers of all kinds) to track down the most terrifying films we could — from jumpy classics like Ring to Demian Rugna's aptly named Terrified. If you're unable to deal with jump-scares , these are not for you. Cushions to hide behind at the ready... What's it about? After undertaking an experimental procedure to restore her hearing, a woman staying in her childhood home experiences auditory hallucinations that may have something to do with her mother's disappearance. Why should you watch it? ""As you might have guessed from that description, [director Jeffrey A.] Brown's movie is a bit of a genre mish-mash,"" I wrote in my review for Mashable . ""The setup sounds like a Black Mirror episode, the hallucinations and isolation are straight-up horror, and the disappearances blend it all together with a kind of mystery/crime/thriller element. It's a combination that could easily start tripping over itself, but somehow it keeps a steady, confident footing. Between Brown's perfectly unnerving direction, a tight script from Michael and Shawn Rasmussen and a well-acted story, The Unheard crackles through its two-hour runtime with scares and tension aplenty."" How to watch: The Unheard is streaming now on Shudder . What's it about? Given how experimental Kyle Edward Ball's movie is, this one's sort of hard to summarise. But it's essentially about two siblings who can't find their dad and are trapped in a dark house by themselves with only a whispering voice for company. Why should you watch it? ""It totally and entirely wants to terrify us,"" writes Jason Adams for Mashable in his explainer . "" Skinamarink wants us to become children trapped in our beds again. It wants the very concept of the dark to be foreign, filled with questions and strangeness and terror. Forcing us back to when we were little and we didn't know more than what was right in front of us, when what lay beyond our hallway or, God forbid, our front door might as well be the edge of the flat earth, falling off into nothingness."" * How to watch: Skinamarink is streaming now on Shudder . What's it about? In 1974, Val (Rose Williams) starts a new job as a nurse in a London hospital. But she soon discovers that the oppressive hierarchy and rolling blackouts aren't the only horrible things she'll have to confront. Why should you watch it? ""It's the perfect setup for building a creeping sense of dread [...] and [writer/director Corinna] Faith does this with a deft hand,"" I wrote in my review for Mashable . ""There are plenty of jump scares, too, but these never feel gratuitous — like all the best scary films, The Power 's horror is used to draw out the movie's main themes, rather than wielding them for mere shock value. ""All in all, the film is pretty hard to fault. The performances are excellent all-round, with Rose Williams showing off incredible range in the central role."" How to watch: The Power is streaming now on Shudder . What's it about? After the strange death of their mother, a family begins to suspect that her presence may not have entirely left the house. Why's it so scary? Indonesian director Joko Anwar knows how to make a creepy film. It's apparent during the opening scenes in Satan's Slaves , when Rini (Tara Basro) makes a grim discovery in her mother's bedroom, and it only gets clearer from there on out. The movie has a solid mixture of slow build, bumps-in-the-night style tension, and outright jump-scares, putting you on edge early and offering little by way of reprieve. For fans of Ring (which features further down on this list), there's even a very creepy well... How to watch: Satan's Slaves is streaming now on Shudder . What's it about? A journalist attempts to get to the bottom of a cursed video tape, which supposedly kills the viewer a week after they've watched it. Why's it so scary? Hideo Nakata's 1998 horror classic not only kick-started a global franchise, but it also proved you don't necessarily need high-tech special effects and intense music to generate scares. By today's standards, Ring may not provide as many jump-scares as some as the other films on this list, but there are still plenty of nightmare-inducing scenes and images (and you probably won't ever look at a well, or a grainy TV set, in quite the same way again). How to watch : Ring is streaming now on Shudder . What's it about? A brother and sister return to their parents' farmhouse to help their mother care for their dying father. But after things take a sudden, tragic turn, they realise something more sinister is going on. Why’s it so scary? Creaky old remote farmhouses are already the ideal setting for jumps, but Bryan Bertino's chiller is extra effective because of its use of sound — whether it's jangling horseshoes placed to ward off evil, a jagged background score or simply yawning, empty silence. The jumps in this one are unexpected and genuinely terrifying, and the story is unremittingly bleak. How to watch: The Dark and the Wicked is streaming now on Shudder . What's it about? Unable to meet in person due to the coronavirus lockdown, a group of friends decide to try out a seance over Zoom. Why's it so scary? One word: realism. The premise of the story , its Zoom setting, and the very natural dialogue all conspire to make Host feel horribly realistic. It's like you're watching the recording of an actual Zoom call between friends, and that makes it all the more unnerving when things begin to go really, really wrong. Oh, and if you're worried that the movie's set-up might be limiting in terms of scares, don't be: the jumps in this one are frequent, and — thanks to the creativity of director Rob Savage — always inventive. How to watch: Host is streaming now on Shudder . What's it about? A group of paranormal investigators examines some disturbing goings-on in a neighbourhood in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Why's it so scary? Rather than just having one scary monster or theme, Demián Rugna's Terrified has a whole bunch of them — from IT -style voices gurgling away in the drain to the unmoving corpse of a dead child, returned home from the grave to sit stiffly at the dinner table. Basically, the film is a trick box full of scares, and if one thing doesn't get to you, chances are something else certainly will. How to watch: Terrified is now streaming on Shudder . What's it about? After the opening of a haunted house tourist attraction results in death, a fictional documentary crew tries to uncover what really happened. Why's it so scary? Like all the best found-footage horror movies, Stephen Cognetti's Hell House LLC uses realism to amp up its fear factor, splicing shaky camera shots with moving mannequins and half-glimpsed figures in the night. The tourist attraction setting could easily have come across as cheesy in this one, but luckily the movie's prop department sourced some genuinely creepy-looking clowns for the occasion (one of which provides more than a few nasty jumps). How to watch: Hell House LLC is streaming now on Shudder . What's it about? A mother grows increasingly worried about her eight-year-old son after he gets a new imaginary friend called ""Z."" Why's it so scary? If the likes of The Babadook and Hide and Seek have taught us anything, it's that children having imaginary friends (at least in the context of a horror movie) is never a great thing. Brandon Christensen's Z takes this concept and gives it a fresh twist, putting us in the shoes of Beth (Keegan Connor Tracy) as she grows increasingly disturbed by her son's behaviour. The thing that makes Z so unnerving isn't so much the creepy child aspect as it is the unknowable monster — the lingering idea of ""Z,"" this unseen creature that dominates every scene with its absence. The fear of seeing something is often more disturbing than the thing itself, and this is an idea that the movie understands perfectly well — and uses to nail-biting effect.

When steel is green,"Talk about sustainable modes of construction, and the first concept that emerges is mud, clay bricks, fly ash, plantation or salvaged wood, to mention a few. The entire concept revolves around using materials with the least carbon footprint, especially locally sourced. The construction methodologies are expected to be location-centric and site-sensitive, even the design tweaked to meet local conditions and modes of construction and material use. In this context, steel as a material features on the other side of the spectrum, given its acknowledged carbon footprint. Incidentally, the most sustainable construction methodologies tout the absence of steel to reiterate their strong green quotient. Yet, a walk through the works of Architects Piyush Kapadia and Pooja Kapadia of Pooja & Piyush Associates speaks a totally different story; the duo’s projects come with a strong green quotient where the construction is done not with mud or clay but steel. Veering towards a complete steel construction, their buildings are assembled in record time, akin to a set of Lego blocks where the entire structure is erected using steel pipes connected in place using nuts and bolts. The steel story of Pooja and Piyush began when they received the project Heer Radha Residence to execute. Just before this project, the duo had to complete an industrial project where the execution time was extremely short, prompting them to adopt pre-engineered techniques to complete the project in a record two and half months. The execution of this project made both realise that similar techniques and approaches can also be extended to residences too while keeping the green quotient high. Thus started their tryst with steel, yet keeping intact the sustainable aspect. “The embodied energy going into steel is accounted for when it is manufactured. But if it can be dismantled and reused, the reuse of it negates this, bringing in the sustainability factor. The fact that the construction is fast, durable, can be easily altered and is less labour intensive also makes it a fine choice for residential and commercial buildings”, explains Piyush on the choice of steel as a green material. He further opines that it is all about the mindset of the unconventional nature of the structure. Adopting this perspective, Piyush and Pooja came up with a composite steel structure for the Heer Radha Residence, where the structure comes with no lintels, no overhangs, and no sunshades. PVC replaces the use of plywood, and salvaged wood is used where wood is required. There is also an absence of plastering as well as POP, resulting in the reduction of cement used to the tune of 55 per cent as compared to a conventional structure. Since there is no concrete but only steel being used, the foundation required is also light, with the columns and beams featuring in the building being steel sans the concrete. The walls are built using clay blocks where they remain exposed without plastering, once again saving the use of cement and sand, all of which pare down the carbon footprint. The ceiling is RCC but is again exposed without plaster, saving on the use of cement and sand. “An interesting aspect of this structure was the accommodation of all factors that were earlier shunned or negated by our earlier clients. This makes the project literally an exhibit of all that was considered inappropriate as appropriate,” smiles Piyush. To lend a sense of timelessness, the structure is kept totally white, the design language lending itself for easy alteration to adapt to changing requirements and lifestyles over the years. The climate responsiveness of the building is high, designed specifically with balconies to buffer the heat ingress. “The design resonates with the vernacular approach to buildings where large verandas marked the residences on all four sides as buffer zones.” Further, the orientation has been deftly addressed to let in the cool breeze during the day. The ground level is designed with open free sections so as to evolve over time “where alterations to changing requirements can be done with ease and least disturbance to the structure.” The interior free-flowing spaces also come with an absence of walls to demarcate functional zones, once again reducing the structural form and the ensuing carbon footprint. “We have cleverly used wardrobe cabinets as demarcating elements between functional zones rather than structural walls. This again makes the spaces totally flexible and easily adaptable to changes by merely removing the storage elements”, points Piyush. If the green quotient is to rule high, natural insulation of the interiors is imperative. The structure comes with a dynamic elevation where the aluminium pivoted louvres wrap the façade, featuring rotatable fins. Northwest and Southeast are known for bringing in maximum heat ingress into the interiors. Piyush and Pooja stemmed this by structuring the walls on this section in perforated clay blocks to offer insulation. The terrace comes layered with glazed tiles to reduce heat ingress further. The walls featuring on the service section housing the toilets, are built using lightweight Aerated Autoclaved blocks to permit utility conduits to run through them. “These walls also reduce the load on the structure besides reducing the use of brick and mortar”, elaborates Piyush. The residence further uses solar power to address 90 per cent of its power requirements, adding to the green quotient. The passive cooling methods opted for, and the ample natural light seeping into the interiors once again reduces the consumption of electricity by 25 per cent. “Given the reduction of walls in the residence by three times, the area needing to be painted also comes down drastically, again adding to the green footprint in terms of maintenance and usage of materials during the lifetime of the building”, states Piyush. Since there is a reduction in the walls, the weight of the building is reduced to half of a conventional building of the same size. “Though the cost of steel used is about 10 to 15 per cent more than a conventional building, the easy recyclability of steel as a material along with the greater possibilities of keying in other green factors makes this construction methodology a potential future mode of construction”, opines Piyush. Taking forward the learnings from the Heer Radha Residence, the duo built their succeeding project, the Nuts and Bolts Residence, too, in steel. Coming up on a narrow 10x15m site with two side roads, the ground plus two structure is built using circular steel columns that feature on the periphery, leaving the interiors open and flexible. The eastern sections come with larger openings, while the west side is shielded with utilities, successfully addressing the orientation of the building. Perforated clay blocks on the outer walls add to the interior insulation. Salvaged vertical wooden rotatable louvres cover the façade, replacing conventional grills. Ample cross ventilation and the facility to suck out hot air through vents successfully address passive cooling. Greens wrap the louvres in the elevation to add to the cooling. The building is marked by an absence of sunshades, lintels and balconies, speaking a language of terracotta, exposed steel, wooden louvres and greenery. The structure was erected in just eight days, while the entire project was completed in four months. Picture credits: Pooja & Piyush Associates",entertainment

Pokemon Scarlet and Violet Teal Mask: Where to find Mienfoo and Mienshao?,"Mienfoo and its evolved form, Mienshao, are two of the most powerful Pokemon that have been added to Pokemon Scarlet and Violet with the Teal Mask DLC. That said, they are some of the rarest Pokemon that you will come across in Kitakami, which is why there are many in the community who have been having a rather tough time acquiring them. Mienfoo is located in specific areas of the new region, and to get Mienshao, you will just need to evolve Mienfoo. Mienshao is one of the best late-game additions, so if you do have a slot for it, then it’s recommended that you have this Pokemon in your line-up. Today’s Pokemon Scarlet and Violet guide will go over everything you need to do in order to get your hands on a Mienfoo and Mienshao in the Teal Mask DLC. You will be able to encounter a Mienfoo in two separate locations in the Kitakami area; one is right in the middle of the map, and the other is to the left and the southwest area. However, one guaranteed spawn point in the game is in the Chilling Waterhead, a cave in the Oni Mountain. When you are near the Oni Mountain, search for a cave entrance that is across a ravine, after crossing it, you will be able to make your way into the Chilling Waterhead. You will find Mienfoo spawn points here. Mienshao is even rarer to find than a Mienfoo in Kitakami, so the best way of getting this Pokemon will be to evolve a Mienfoo after you catch one. The evolution process is very straightforward, and you will be able to complete it after taking Mienfoo to level 50. You can accomplish this by using it in battle or using Exp Candies to level it up . However, it’s recommended to do the former, as Mienfoo is incredibly powerful in the game. Additionally, it’s also likely that you will get to catch a Mienfoo that is much above level 50 due to the level scaling feature that Teal Mask introduces . So if the Mienfoo you have captured is above level 50, by just leveling it up once, you will be able to evolve it into a Mienshao. Quick Links",sports

"IND vs BAN, Asia Cup 2023: Bangladesh Beat India By 6 Runs To End Campaign On High","googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); Bangladesh beat Bangladesh by 6 runs in an absolute thriller of a match at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Friday (September 15). In what was the final match of the Super Four stage of the continental tournament, the result of which had no impact on the final lineup with both Sri Lanka and India having sealed a place in the summit clash, India decided to bowl first. After being reduced to 59/4, a partnership between Shakib Al Hasan (80 off 85) and Towhid Hridoy (54 off 81) helped them revive their innings as they eventually posted 265/8. In response, India lost early wickets but Shubman Gill held his end up and responded with a fine century (121). However, Bangladesh continued to take wickets and eventually find a way to get past Gill with the required run rate mounting. Axar Patel showed some fight with the bat scoring 42 off 34 but got out in the penultimate over of the match. With 12 needed of 6 balls, Mohammed Shami did manage to find a boundary but got run out in an attempt to get back on strike for the final ball, ending India's innings at 259. Shakib was adjudged the Player of the match for his all-round contribution as he scalped 1 for 43 after his invaulable contribution with the bat. Debutant Tanzim Hasan Sakib also had a game to remember as he sent back Rohit Sharma for a two-ball duck before also picking the wicket of Tilak Varma. He returned to defend 12 off the last over although it helped that India had just one wicket remaining. The result means India's unbeaten run in the continental tournament ends before they play the final at the same venue on Sunday (September 17). Bangladesh, meanwhile, managed to end their campaign on a high registering their solitary win of the Super 12 stage after succumbing to a defeat against Pakistan and Sri Lanka earlier.",sports
Will Naseem Shah Be Ready For Pakistan's World Cup Matches? Uncertainty Looms Over Right-Arm Pacer's Availability,"Colombo: Pakistan's captain, Babar Azam, has raised concerns about the possibility of fast bowler Naseem Shah's timely recovery for their initial matches in the upcoming World Cup in India. However, there's better news regarding their star pacer Haris Rauf, who is ""recovering well"" from a side strain and is expected to be fit for their opening match against the Netherlands in Hyderabad on October 6. Both Naseem and Haris sustained injuries during Pakistan's Super Four clash against India in the Asia Cup and were sidelined as the team exited the tournament following a loss to Sri Lanka in Colombo. The Pakistan Cricket Board has not yet provided an official timeline for Naseem's recovery from a right shoulder injury. In light of this uncertainty, Babar Azam expressed doubts about Naseem's fitness for the start of the World Cup. While addressing the situation, Babar Azam mentioned, ""I'll tell you later... Not revealing our Plan B at this moment. But, yes, Haris Rauf is making good progress. He's dealing with a minor side strain, and he's expected to recover before the World Cup."" googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); Regarding Naseem Shah's condition, Babar added, ""Naseem Shah also... they have a couple of mismatches, I don't know how long the recovery will take, but in my opinion, Naseem Shah will also be available for the World Cup later on. But let's see."" Naseem Shah, who is just 20 years old, has had a history of injuries, including a back problem at the age of 17 that sidelined him for 14 months. After his return, he suffered a shoulder injury during his debut appearance in the County Championship with Gloucestershire, keeping him out of action for an additional month. Although initially known as a red-ball specialist, he has evolved into a key bowler for Pakistan in all three formats of the game. In ODIs, Naseem has emerged as Pakistan's most potent bowler, claiming 32 wickets in just 14 matches, all at an average of less than 17. Teams have until September 28 to submit their squads to the ICC for the six-week tournament, and they can only make changes to their 15-player squads after that date with the permission of the event organizers. Pakistan doesn't have any official 50-over matches scheduled before the World Cup, but they do have two warm-up games against New Zealand (on September 29) and Australia (on October 3), although these games do not hold official ODI status.

"Chiefs' Kelce, Jones to play Sunday vs. Jaguars","KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Travis Kelce and Chris Jones will play for the Kansas City Chiefs in Sunday's game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, barring any setbacks, coach Andy Reid said Friday. Officially, Kelce was listed as questionable for the game. Running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire (illness) also was listed as questionable. Kelce missed last week's season opener after hyperextending his right knee. The passing game struggled without him, and the Chiefs lost 21-20 to the Detroit Lions. He returned to practice this week wearing a sleeve on his injured right leg. Jones also didn't play against the Lions, but he joined the Chiefs on Wednesday for the start of their practice week. He ended his holdout that began at training camp. He had one season remaining on his contract but wanted a new multiyear deal. Jones and the Chiefs couldn't agree on a longer-term contract, but Jones signed a new one-year deal that, with incentives, could earn him more than his base salary of $19.5 million.",sports
"Ravens already ailing, down 4 starters vs. Cincy","OWINGS MILLS, Md. -- All week, the Baltimore Ravens talked about how it will be ""next man up"" for Sunday's game at the Cincinnati Bengals. To be accurate, it's going to be next men up for the injury-decimated Ravens. On Friday, the Ravens revealed how short-handed they will be against the two-time defending AFC North champion Bengals, ruling out four starters: offensive tackle Ronnie Stanley (knee), center Tyler Linderbaum (ankle), cornerback Marlon Humphrey (foot) and safety Marcus Williams (pectoral). All but Humphrey were injured in a costly season-opening, 25-9 win over the Houston Texans. Along with running back J.K. Dobbins, who tore an Achilles tendon against the Texans, these five players account for 21.4% of Baltimore's salary cap in 2023. ""It's no excuses,"" Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson said earlier this week. ""It's tough just because they're key players, but we have guys that are going to step up and lead us out there on that field and do what they're supposed to do."" The good news for Baltimore is that Pro Bowl tight end Mark Andrews was a full participant in Friday's practice, which means he is trending toward playing after missing the season opener with a quadriceps injury. The bad news is it's uncertain when any of these other injured players will be back. Dobbins, who had surgery Friday, is out for the season. Stanley and Linderbaum could miss multiple weeks, and Williams is expected to be out for an extended period. Humphrey is considered the player who is the closest to return. This continues a streak of injury issues for the Ravens when they face the Bengals. Jackson has been injured for the team's past three trips to Cincinnati, all losses. Now, with Jackson healthy, Baltimore will be without half of its starting secondary against quarterback Joe Burrow and won't have two starters on the offensive line. ""Everybody has each other's backs, and we know that if one goes down, the next man has got to fill the void,"" Ravens wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. said. ""It's just a mentality thing that I think the very good teams have, and I know we have that here."" Patrick Mekari is expected to fill in for Stanley at left tackle, and Sam Mustipher is likely to step in for Linderbaum at center. Geno Stone will probably take over Williams' spot at free safety. ""Our players are confident in their teammates, their brothers-in-arms,"" Ravens coach John Harbaugh said. ""They believe in one another, and they're excited to see those guys play. I see why it's a topic, but it's not really a topic in our inner circle. We're just going to play the game."" With Dobbins done for the season, it's been speculated that Baltimore will split the backfield carries between Gus Edwards and Justice Hill. Asked which Ravens running back he would start on his fantasy team, Harbaugh smiled and said: ""I'm sorry, I don't have the fantasy answer. I apologize for that.""",sports
U-M's Howard recovering from heart procedure,"Michigan coach Juwan Howard underwent a successful heart procedure Friday, the school announced. Howard had a scheduled operation to resect an aortic aneurysm and repair an aortic valve, conditions identified during a routine medical check earlier this offseason. Dr. Himanshu Patel, who performed the operation, said Howard is expected to fully recover in six to 12 weeks and could return to the program in four to six weeks. ""I feel so grateful and blessed that this surgery was performed at University of Michigan Health,"" Howard said in a statement. ""My wife, Jenine, and our family appreciate the world-class care that has been provided to us. Dr. [Kim] Eagle, Dr. Patel, Dr. [Stanley] Chetcuti, and all of the staff at the Frankel Cardiovascular Center are so talented and performed like champions throughout this process. I am going to work very hard in my rehabilitation to be stronger than ever by the time our upcoming season is upon us."" Associate head coach Phil Martelli will serve as the Wolverines' interim head coach during Howard's absence. Martelli spent 24 seasons as the head coach at Saint Joseph's, making seven NCAA tournament appearances, including an Elite Eight run in 2004. He was fired in 2019 and joined Howard's staff four months later. ""We are extremely grateful Juwan's proactive procedure was a success and that he is resting comfortably,"" athletic director Warde Manuel said in a statement. ""We will continue to support Juwan, Jenine and his family as well as the program throughout his absence. All of us at the athletic department have Juwan in our thoughts and prayers.

Chargers say RB Ekeler doubtful to play Sunday,"COSTA MESA, Calif. -- Los Angeles Chargers running back Austin Ekeler and linebacker Eric Kendricks are doubtful to play at the Tennessee Titans on Sunday, while outside linebacker Joey Bosa is questionable. All three players were injured in the season-opening 36-34 loss to the Miami Dolphins on Sunday. Ekeler hurt his ankle, and Kendricks and Bosa each suffered hamstring injuries. Ekeler ran for 117 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries and had 47 yards receiving but did not play on the Chargers' final possession. Coach Brandon Staley said Ekeler's injury is not a high-ankle sprain. Joshua Kelley, who had 91 yards rushing and a touchdown on 16 carries, will start if Ekeler doesn't play. ""So, my mentality is I'm gonna dominate and take every possession, every rep to the best of my ability,"" Kelley said Friday. Elijah Dotson, a rookie undrafted free agent, and Isaiah Spiller, a second-year back who was inactive on Sunday, are set to back up Kelley. The Chargers also signed Jaret Patterson, who ran for 344 yards and two touchdowns the past two seasons for the Washington Commanders, to their practice squad on Wednesday. ""I feel like our [running backs] coach [Derrick Foster] said it,"" Kelley said. ""He's like, 'Hey, we guys need you to roll,' and we got to answer the call."" The loss of Kendricks will test the Chargers' run defense, which allowed 70 yards on 20 carries to the Dolphins. Kendricks, who made seven tackles and had one pass defended in his Chargers debut after playing his first eight seasons for the Minnesota Vikings, was signed in free agency to help stabilize a group that allowed an NFL-worst 5.42 yards per carry in 2022. Titans star Derrick Henry had 63 yards rushing on 15 carries and also caught two passes for 56 yards in a 16-15 loss at the New Orleans Saints. If Kendricks cannot play, linebacker Kenneth Murray Jr. will call plays on defense. The injury to Kendricks leaves the Chargers short-handed at inside linebacker. Rookie third-round draft pick Daiyan Henley is listed as doubtful because of a hamstring injury and expected to miss his second straight game, leaving Nick Niemann and Amen Ogbongbemiga are expected to take Kendricks' place next to Murray. ""Yeah, I mean, certainly the group is going to have to pick up for Eric,"" Staley said. ""And it will be a great opportunity for those young guys."" Bosa's absence comes after he missed 12 games last season because of a groin injury that required surgery. He had 2.5 sacks in five games, both career lows, after reaching double-digit sacks in four of his first six seasons. Bosa was limited in practice on Friday, working out on his own with a trainer off to the side during the portion open to the media. ""It'll be a game-time decision,"" Staley said. ""He was able to do some stuff out there on the field today."" Bosa had one tackle and finished with a 21.1% pass rush win rate on 39 snaps, according to TruMedia data. The Chargers did not sack Tua Tagovailoa on Sunday. The 466 yards passing allowed was the most in franchise history.",sports
Jets' Rodgers to his doubters: 'Watch what I do',"A defiant Aaron Rodgers, only two days removed from Achilles tendon surgery, vowed Friday to make a full recovery, confirming he intends to continue his career with the New York Jets. While acknowledging ""some odds [are] stacked against me based on age,"" the 39-year-old quarterback -- the oldest player in the NFL -- said he intends to prove the naysayers wrong. ""Give me the doubts, give me the timetables, give me all the things that you think can, should or will happen, because all I need is that one little extra percent of inspiration,"" he said on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" -- his first public comments since the injury. ""That's all I need. So, give me your doubts, give me your prognostications and then watch what I do."" While he avoided giving any specific timetables, Rodgers didn't dismiss the possibility of returning for the postseason -- which seems highly unlikely based on the traditional rehab period. ""I think as Kevin Garnett said, 'Anything is possible,'"" he said. The four-time MVP said he already has ""put together a pretty damn good rehab plan that's going to, I think, shock some people."" Speaking from his home in Malibu, California, Rodgers was in an upbeat mood. It was much different Monday night at MetLife Stadium, where he sobbed uncontrollably in the Jets trainers' room. He said he knew immediately he had torn the Achilles. He had ""popped"" his calf a few times in his career, but this felt different. He described it as a ""drop-foot"" sensation. Rodgers called it ""one of the toughest 24-hour stretches I've had in my life."" From the stadium, he texted Los Angeles-based doctor Neal ElAttrache, who treated his broken collarbone in 2017. Rodgers also remembered that ElAttrache had repaired Kobe Bryant's torn Achilles in 2013 -- an eight-month recovery. ""I didn't want to waste any time,"" said Rodgers, who was injured on the fourth snap of the Jets' season-opening win over the Buffalo Bills. He was at his New Jersey home by the time Xavier Gipson won the game with a walk-off touchdown on a punt return in overtime. By Wednesday, he was in Los Angeles for surgery. ""A lot of sadness, a lot of tears, a lot of dark frustration and anger, the gamut of emotions,"" he said. ""But the sun rose the next day and I found myself in L.A. and had surgery on Wednesday, and since then I've been feeling better."" Rodgers wouldn't say how long he'd be in Los Angeles, but he indicated a desire to return to the team to help out behind the scenes. Los Angeles Rams running back Cam Akers made headlines in 2021 for his quick return from a torn Achilles. It happened in July, and he made it back for the final regular-season game and postseason -- a five-month recovery. ""I'm going to try and push this thing as much as it'll allow me to,"" Rodgers said. ""And there are markers. I've got to see where I'm at after a week and two weeks and a month and two months, and then we'll see what the conversation is from there."" He said he's in fact-finding mode, having spent the past two days calling people for advice and information on how to attack his rehab. Coach Robert Saleh said the team eagerly awaits Rodgers' return. ""We've been in contact with him daily,"" Saleh said. ""He's excited to get back here. Obviously, there's a healing process he has to go through with the incisions and all that stuff, but as soon as that's done, we'll get him back here. But he's fully engaged. He's awesome."" Meanwhile, the Jets are dealing with a new injury that could impact their plans for Sunday's game at the Dallas Cowboys. Kicker Greg Zuerlein didn't practice Friday after injuring his groin Thursday, and he's listed as questionable for the game. The Jets were scheduled to audition kickers Friday, just in case Zuerlein can't play. ""It's not serious,"" Saleh said, ""but serious enough to bring this game into question.""",sports
Vikes' Mattison says racist vitriol 'unacceptable',"Minnesota Vikings running back Alexander Mattison said early Friday morning that he received more than 60 ""disgustingly disrespectful messages"" through his Instagram account, including several that used the N-word and other slurs, after the team's 34-28 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. Mattison, who rushed for 28 yards on eight carries and lost a first-quarter fumble, posted two of the messages on his Instagram story. Both called for him to commit suicide. ""Y'all can come at me all you want about fantasy and 'you suck' blah blah blah,"" Mattison wrote on Instagram. ""I really could care less. But this s--- is unacceptable."" Mattison went on to say that he hopes those who sent the messages reflect on what ""you say and how it could truly affect someone. Under my helmet, I am a human, a father, a son. This is sick."" The Vikings and the NFL both issued statements of support Friday afternoon via X, formerly Twitter. ""We are sickened by the hatred and racial slurs directed toward Alexander Mattison following last night's game,"" the Vikings said in the statement. ""There simply is no room for racist words or actions in sports or society. The Vikings will continue to fight to eliminate hate, to educate and to foster a diverse, equitable, and inclusive community that respects and values our unique backgrounds. We stand with Alexander and all players who, unfortunately, experience this type of ignorant and prejudicial behavior, and we ask our fans to continue to fight to eliminate racism."" The NFL said it ""strongly condemns"" the racist comments, calling such behavior ""completely unacceptable in the NFL or anywhere else."" ""We stand firmly with Alexander and remind fans to remember the humanity of all players and celebrate their contributions to the game we all love,"" the league said.",sports
"All iPhone 15 models have slightly larger batteries than their predecessors, exact capacities revealed","Apple is and always has been notorious for not publishing the actual battery capacities of its devices as part of its spec sheets, and so if you're interested in the exact numbers you generally have to wait until people get the new iPhones in hand and disassemble them. Or, like in today's case, wait for China's regulators to certify the new models for sale in the country. Such a certification is exactly what surfaced today, revealing the fact that all four iPhone 15 models have ever so slightly larger batteries than their predecessors. Let's dive in. The iPhone 15 's cell is 3,349 mAh, up from 3,279 mAh on the iPhone 14 . The iPhone 15 Plus gets 4,383 mAh, up from 4,325 mAh on the iPhone 14 Plus . The iPhone 15 Pro 's battery capacity is 3,274 mAh, up from 3,200 mAh on the iPhone 14 Pro . Finally, the iPhone 15 Pro Max beats them all with its 4,422 mAh cell, up from 4,323 mAh in the iPhone 14 Pro Max . These increases are, as you can see, minute. So if there will be any noticeable improvements in battery life, they will most likely come from more efficient chipsets and screens - not from these under-100 mAh gains in battery sizes. The iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus , iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max were unveiled at a special event on Tuesday, and they all went up for pre-order today in dozens of markets globally.

Throwing shades: Deion dives in on Norvell's diss,"If Colorado coach Deion Sanders gets his way, everyone around Boulder will be wearing sunglasses for this weekend's Rocky Mountain Showdown with Colorado State. In response to comments from Colorado State coach Jay Norvell, Sanders gave the hosts of ""First Take"" and ""The Pat McAfee Show"" with pairs of Prime 21 sunglasses from Blenders to wear on set. He also passed them out to Colorado players during a team meeting Thursday. During his radio show Wednesday, Norvell took a shot at Sanders' habit of wearing a hat and/or sunglasses during media interviews. ""I sat down with ESPN today. And I don't care if they hear it in Boulder. I told them, 'I took my hat off, and I took my glasses off.' And I said, 'When I talk to grown-ups, I take my hat and my glasses off.' That's what my mother taught me,"" Norvell said. ""They're not going to like us, no matter what we say or do. It doesn't matter. So, let's go up there and play."" Sanders told McAfee that he didn't love Norvell's comments initially, even though they provided the latest motivation for Colorado after a 2-0 start. ""I didn't like that it happened because it's another [Black coach],"" Sanders said. ""We started out right? He was complimenting me, I was complimenting him, but it just took a quick left. What happened? Who got to him? After what he said previously, it threw me off and I started, I really started to contemplate, what happened? Why would you go into that direction? You know me, you know how I get down. If we really want to talk, I can do this. I'm pretty good at this, but I don't need to, because the kids, they're ready."" Sanders added that he doesn't believe in trap games, but the Colorado State matchup, ahead of games against Oregon and USC, has been ratcheted up after Norvell's comments. ""My kids are now on a 10,"" Sanders said. ""They are ready to play this game and they can't wait to play this game. We can't wait to get it on.""",sports
Apple to Update Software on iPhone 12s in France to Settle Radiation Dispute,"pledged on Friday to update software on s in France to settle a dispute over radiation levels, but concerns in other European countries signalled it may have to take similar action elsewhere. France this week suspended sales of iPhone 12 handsets after tests which it said found breaches of radiation exposure limits. Apple contested the findings, saying the iPhone 12 was certified by multiple international bodies as compliant with global standards, but said on Friday it would issue a software update to accommodate the testing methods used in France. Researchers have conducted a vast number of studies over the last two decades to assess the health risks of mobile phones. According to the World Health Organisation, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by them. But the radiation warning in France, based on results of tests that differ from those carried out in other countries, has prompted concerns across Europe. Belgium's state secretary for digitalisation said he had asked Apple to upgrade the iPhone 12 software across EU countries, even though he said that based on the Belgian regulator's own preliminary review the handset presents no danger to users. Germany said it was in touch with French authorities to find a European Union-wide solution, while Italy was set to ask Apple to upgrade the software on iPhone 12s there, according to a government source in Rome. However, any request to Apple or separate decisions by Italian authorities will only come after the end of the French investigation, a second Italian government source said. The Dutch Authority for Digital Infrastructure said it was also conducting its own investigation, due in two weeks, and was in contact with Apple as well as German and French authorities. The agency said it had received calls from concerned consumers. The French government welcomed Apple's software update, saying it would be swiftly tested and should allow for sales of the relatively old iPhone 12 model, launched in 2020, to resume. ""We will issue a software update for users in France to accommodate the protocol used by French regulators. We look forward to iPhone 12 continuing to be available in France,"" Apple said in a statement. ""This is related to a specific testing protocol used by French regulators and not a safety concern,"" it said. Apple routinely provides software updates for its phones and computers, mostly to fix a security issue. They can be focused on a particular model or a region, and sometimes Apple issues such updates several times in a month. France's Agence Nationale des Frequences (ANFR) said on Tuesday the iPhone 12's Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) — a measure of the rate of radiofrequency energy absorbed by the body from a piece of equipment — was higher than legally allowed, which prompted the sale suspension. A change in French regulations in 2020 allowed for testing SAR for limbs — holding a phone in hand — as well as for the head and body, used elsewhere. In the French limb SAR tests, which the iPhone 12 failed, it is measured at a distance of 0 mm compared with a distance of 5mm for body tests. The Belgian minister for digitalisation, Mathieu Michel, said in a statement on Friday that while a review of the phone by the country's IBPT regulator was still underway, the first results were ""reassuring"" and there was no need for a recall of the phone in Belgium. Even so, he said he had contacted Apple and asked it to ""review its software updates in an identical manner within the whole of Europe."" Denmark too moved to reassure owners of the phone, saying its Safety Authority would not take action following France's findings and that it was not concerned about radiation levels from using the iPhone 12. ""Based on the available information, the Danish Health Authority's assessment is that you can continue to use your iPhone 12 without concern,"" it said in an emailed statement. Industry experts said there were no safety risks as regulatory limits, based on the risk of burns or heatstroke from the phone's radiation, were set well below levels where scientists have found evidence of harm. ""Ultimately I suspect the whole incident will be quickly forgotten,"" said Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight, highlighting that the iPhone 12 is an old model. Apple launched the on Tuesday and the iPhone 12 is not available to buy from Apple directly. It can, however, be bought from third parties that have inventory or trade old phones. A bigger issue would have been a potential recall, which France had threatened if Apple had refused to do a software update. Apple's revenues totalled about $95 billion (nearly Rs. 7,89,600 crore) in Europe last year, making the region its second biggest behind the Americas. Some estimates say it sold more than 50 million iPhones last year in Europe. The US company does not break out its sales by country or model. For the latest and , follow Gadgets 360 on , , and .

Sources: Alabama to start QB Buchner vs. USF,"Alabama appears to be making a change at quarterback. Sophomore Tyler Buchner is expected to start over Jalen Milroe when the 10th-ranked Crimson Tide play at South Florida on Saturday (3:30 p.m. ET, ABC), sources told ESPN's Chris Low. Buchner, who transferred from Notre Dame in the spring, took the majority of first-team reps in practice this week, sources said. Milroe started the Crimson Tide's first two games, but he threw two interceptions in Alabama's 34-24 loss to Texas last week. Buchner played under Alabama offensive coordinator Tommy Rees last season when both were at Notre Dame. He played in mop-up duty during Alabama's season-opening 56-7 win over Middle Tennessee, completing 3 of 5 passes for 27 yards. Buchner began last season as Notre Dame's starting quarterback before getting injured in the season's second game. He returned for the Gator Bowl, accounting for five touchdowns while also throwing three interceptions, including a pick-six, in Notre Dame's 45-38 win over South Carolina.

A Haunting in Venice Movie Review: Kenneth Branagh's New Hercule Poirot Mystery is Effectively Spooky and Intriguing (LatestLY Exclusive),"A Haunting in Venice Movie Review : Kenneth Branagh returns as both the director and the lead character in A Haunting in Venice , the third Hercule Poirot adventure of his franchise. This time, things take a spooky turn. Not only does the period setting align with Halloween, but also, the prime suspects in a murder could be supernatural entities. Even Hercule Poirot's unwavering belief in the absence of the supernatural in our world is put to the test as he unravels one of his darkest mysteries. A Haunting in Venice Review: Kenneth Branagh's Whodunnit-Thriller Receives Mixed Response From Critics . So, what's the case all about? A decade after the events of Death on the Nile , Poirot is pulled out of his idyllic retirement in Venice by an acquaintance, an author named Ariadne Oliver (Tina Fey), who bases her books on his investigations. Ariadne seeks his assistance in exposing a medium named Joyce Reynolds (Michelle Yeoh), whom she suspects is a fraud. Joyce is conducting a séance that evening at Rowena Drake's (Kelly Reilly) haunted house, formerly a hospital where children tragically died. Rowena wishes to contact her deceased daughter, who supposedly died by suicide a year ago. The séance attracts other guests, also including Poirot, Ariadne, and Poirot's bodyguard, Vitale Portfoglio (Riccardo Scamarcio). However, the evening takes a shocking turn with an unexpected death, and as a storm rages outside, Poirot must solve the case before dawn breaks, all while experiencing eerie encounters himself. Watch the Trailer of A Haunting in Venice : I must confess, among all the Hercule Poirot movies directed by Kenneth Branagh, A Haunting in Venice was the one that excited me the most before release. This was the only film where I didn't know the killer's identity beforehand, as I hadn't seen the previous movie adaptations or read Agatha Christie's novel Hallowe'en Party . I've heard that the movie has made significant changes to the setting and characters of the novel, so those unfamiliar with the source material could be in for a surprise. A Haunting in Venice adopts a slower and more atmospheric tone compared to its predecessors, which suits its setting perfectly. Each character is not only unnerved by the house but also haunted by their own pasts. While this may make them less vibrant suspects than in previous films, it occasionally makes the movie feel a bit dull as well especially before the murder happens. However, it also provides Branagh with the opportunity to extract fine performances from his cast, with Reilly, Jamie Dornan, Jude Hill (a mini Belfast reunion here), Tina Fey, Camille Cottin, and Michelle Yeoh all delivering commendable performances. Fey, in particular, adds a lively contrast to Poirot's rather somber nature (I'm not a big fan of how Branagh portrays his weathered detective as so weighed down by life and the deaths he has witnessed). I wonder if he cast her after watching Only Murders in the Building . The slow-paced mystery benefits from moody set design and dim lighting, creating the ideal haunted house atmosphere. Like Poirot, even the audience is made to question whether everything is natural within its walls. However, the horror elements aren't intended to frighten but rather to contribute to the mystical and somber ambiance. This isn't your typical Conjuring experience. The Nun II Movie Review: A Conjuring Spinoff that Falls Flat with Predictable Scares and a Jumbled Plot! Regarding the mystery plot in its entirety, does it ultimately lead to a satisfying conclusion? Perhaps, having devoured numerous mystery novels, including the works of Christie, the culprit turned out to be the individual I had initially suspected, someone who has the most discernible connection to both past and present murders. On a couple of occasions, the film did attempt to shake my certainties, coming tantalisingly close to success, but in the end... A Haunting in Venice ranks as my second favorite installment in Kenneth Branagh's series of Hercule Poirot films, trailing only behind Murder on the Orient Express . Although its deliberate pacing and somber atmosphere may not cater to every palate, Branagh's direction, the eerie ambiance of the film, and the stellar performances all contribute admirably to maintaining the enigmatic allure of this mystery.

Asia Cup 2023: Rohit Sharma registers unwanted Indian record after getting dismissed for duck vs Bangladesh,"Team India skipper 's merry run in the ongoing Asia Cup came to an end with a duck in the Super Fours clash against Bangladesh in Colombo on Friday, September 15. Rohit, who was coming off from three half-centuries in a row, was dismissed for a two-ball duck by debutant Bangladesh pacer Tanzim Sakib in the very first over of the Indian innings. Rohit went through his shot trying to hit over covers but gave a simple catch to the point. This was Rohit's third duck in the ODI Asia Cup and was the first Indian to register three ducks in the tournament and fifth batter overall. 3 - (Bangladesh) 3 - Salman Butt (Pakistan) 3 - Aminul Islam (Bangladesh) 3 - Mahela Jayawardene (Sri Lanka) 3 - Rohit Sharma (India)* This was Rohit's 15th duck in the format and cricket is a great leveller was just proved since he is still the most consistent batter in the tournament for India. did bat well and scored his fifth ODI century but couldn't take his team to win as none of the batters except Axar Patel offered any resistance. Axar and Shardul almost did the unthinkable for India when the run rate was nearing 10 but in the end 's twin strikes in the penultimate over was enough for Bangladesh to get over the line. Since, it was an inconsequential match, the result didn't matter as India will be still playing the final of the Asia Cup and since the Men in Blue rested half of their first-choice team, they got an idea of how the bench looks like. Axar Patel's batting form will be the biggest positive from the game, apart from Gill's century.",sports

'Keeping bigger picture in mind'- Rohit Sharma explains team changes after narrow defeat against Bangladesh,"Indian cricket team explained changes to the team after a six-run loss to Bangladesh in the Super 4 match of the Asia Cup 2023 on Friday, September 15. India failed to chase the 266-run target despite a brilliant hundred from as Bangladesh walked away with a consolation win. Apart from Gill's impressive knock, the biggest talking point of the game was the five changes made to the playing eleven that beat Sri Lanka on Tuesday. India dropped , , , and Mohammed Siraj to test their bench strength. But India's decision to make this many changes clearly cost them as they suffered their third defeat in the last four ODI encounters against Bangladesh. But Rohit defended his team selection after a heartbreaking loss and said the management was thinking about the bigger picture (future). Rohit said that the changes don't reflect their gameplay as he only wanted to give a chance to players selected in the ICC World Cup 2023 team. Rohit also showered praise on centurion Shubman Gill who now tops the scoring chart in the tournament with 275 runs in five innings. ""We wanted to give some game time to the guys, keeping the bigger picture in mind. Not compromising on how we wanted to play this game. Get in some players who are likely to play in the World Cup. Axar batted brilliantly, but couldn't finish. He showed a lot of character. But credit to the Bangladesh bowlers. Not to forget, Gill's hundred was brilliant. He backs his game; he knows exactly how he wants to play. Pretty clear on what he wants to do for the team. Look at his form over the last year. Pretty solid against the new ball. Works really hard; there's no optional practice for Gill,"" said during the post-match presentation.

"Hurricane Lee targets New England and eastern Canada with wind, roiling seas and rain","Fishermen removed lobster traps from the water and residents hauled hundreds of boats ashore — leaving some harbors looking like ghost towns — while utility workers from as far away as Tennessee began taking up positions Friday ahead of Hurricane Lee’s heavy winds, high seas and rain spanning hundreds of miles (kilometers) of land and sea. The storm is projected to be more than 400 miles (640 kilometers) wide with tropical-storm-force winds when it reaches land, creating worries of power outages in Maine, the nation’s most heavily forested state, where the ground is saturated and trees are weakened from heavy summer rains. Lee remained a hurricane with 80 mph (128 kph) winds Friday afternoon as it headed toward New England and eastern Canada with 20-foot (6-meter) ocean swells, strong winds and rain. Forecasters said there would be winds topping 40 mph (64 kph) across the region ahead of landfall expected Saturday afternoon. There was little else to be done but wait and worry, and make final preparations as Lee spun about 395 miles (635 kilometers) southeast of Nantucket, Massachusetts, and moved away from Bermuda. On Long Island, Maine, off of Portland, commercial lobster fisherman Steve Train had just finished hauling 200 traps out of the water. Train, who is also a firefighter, was going to wait out the storm on the island in Casco Bay. He was not concerned about staying there in the storm. “Not one bit,” he said. In South Thomaston, Dave Cousens, who lost fishing gear when Hurricane Bob came through in 1991, said lobstermen were busy moving their traps, which cost $100 to $170 apiece, out of harm’s way to try to avoid damage from the rough seas. Some were pulling their boats out, as well. While landfall was projected for nearby Nova Scotia, the Category 1 system was big enough to cause concerns over a wide area even if it weakens to a tropical storm. Parts of coastal Maine could see waves up to 15 feet (4.5 meters) high crashing down, causing erosion and damage, and the strong gusts will cause power outages, said Louise Fode, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Maine. Up to 4 inches (10 centimeters) of rain was forecast for eastern Maine. In Canada, Ian Hubbard, a meteorologist for Environment and Climate Change Canada and the Canadian Hurricane Centre, said Lee won’t be anywhere near the severity of the remnants of Hurricane Fiona, which washed houses into the ocean, knocked out power to most of two provinces and swept a woman into the sea a year ago. But it was still a dangerous storm. Kyle Leavitt, director of the New Brunswick Emergency Management Organization, urged residents to stay home, saying, “Nothing good can come from checking out the big waves and how strong the wind truly is.” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was convening the incident response group, which meets only to discuss events with major implications for Canada, on Friday. Consisting of Cabinet ministers and senior officials, it was previously convened over events including the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the record wildfire season this year. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey joined Maine in declaring a state of emergency and asking the Federal Emergency Management Agency to issue a pre-disaster emergency declaration. She also activated up to 50 National Guard members to help with storm preparations, including operating highwater vehicles to respond to flooded areas. The storm's arrival was expected just days after heavy flooding and tornadoes in New England. “As we’ve seen in recent weeks, severe weather is not to be taken lightly. Flooding, wind damage, downed trees, tree limbs — all these things create real hazards and problems for people,” Healey said. East Hampton, New York, barred swimming — and, in at least some places, even walking — on beaches because of dangerous surf. Caution tape was strung up along the edge of the sand at the tony second-home community’s picturesque Main Beach, where waves already were roiling Friday afternoon, News12 Long Island video showed. In Rhode Island, Gov. Dan McKee said crews were working to secure the iconic 11-foot-tall (3.4-meter-tall) “Independent Man” statue atop the State House dome. Workers wanted to safeguard the 500-pound statue against the storm’s wind and rain after a drone recently captured footage showing damage to the base. In Maine, where people are accustomed to damaging winter nor'easters, some brushed aside the coming Lee as something akin to those storms only without the snow. “We fear nor’easters up here more than the remnants of a tropical storm,"" said Andrea Silverthorne, who works in reception and reservations at the Inn on the Wharf in Lubec, Maine's easternmost town. Destructive hurricanes are relatively rare this far to the north, in New England and Atlantic Canada. The Great New England Hurricane of 1938 brought gusts as high as 186 mph (300 kph) and sustained winds of 121 mph (195 kph) at Massachusetts’ Blue Hill Observatory. But there have been no storms that powerful in recent years. The last storm to make landfall in New England as a hurricane was Bob, which tore across Cape Cod and charged northward toward Maine, losing steam and becoming a tropical storm, according to the National Weather Service. The region learned the hard way with Hurricane Irene in 2011 that damage isn’t always confined to the coast. Downgraded to a tropical storm, Irene still caused more than $800 million in damage in Vermont. For this storm, part of Maine was under a hurricane watch for the first time since 2008, for Hurricane Kyle, which skirted eastern Maine. The last hurricane to make landfall in Maine was Hurricane Gerda, which hit Eastport in 1969.",world
"Poland, Hungary, Slovakia to introduce own bans on Ukraine grains","Poland, Slovakia and Hungary announced their own restrictions on Ukrainian grain imports on Friday after the European Commission decided not to extend its ban on imports into Ukraine's five EU neighbours. Ukraine was one of the world's top grain exporters before Russia's 2022 invasion reduced its ability to ship agricultural produce to global markets. Ukrainian farmers have relied on grain exports through neighbouring countries since the conflict began as it has been unable to use the favoured routes through Black Sea ports. But the flood of grains and oilseeds into neighbouring countries reduced prices there, impacting the income of local farmers and resulting in governments banning agricultural imports from Ukraine. The European Union in May stepped in to prevent individual countries imposing unilateral bans and imposed its own ban on imports into neighbouring countries. Under the EU ban, Ukraine was allowed to export through those countries on condition the produce was sold elsewhere. The EU allowed that ban to expire on Friday after Ukraine pledged to take measures to tighten control of exports to neighbouring countries. The issue is a particularly sensitive one now as farmers harvest their crops and prepare to sell. EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said on Friday countries should refrain from unilateral measures against imports of Ukrainian grain, but Poland, Slovakia and Hungary immediately responded by reimposing their own restrictions on Ukrainian grain imports. They will continue to allow the transit of Ukrainian produce. ""As long as Ukraine is able to certify that the grain is going to get to the country of destination, through the trucks and trains, the domestic use ban is not really going to put a dent in Ukraine's ability to get exports out,"" said Terry Reilly, senior agricultural strategist for Marex. He noted that disruptions to Black Sea exports are a bigger concern. It is unclear how much Ukraine has pledged to restrict exports or how the new bans would impact the flow of produce from Ukraine. The issue has underscored division the EU over the impact of the war in Ukraine on the economies of member countries which themselves have powerful agriculture and farming lobbies. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy welcomed the EU's decision not to further extend the ban on Kyiv's grain exports, but said his government would react ""in civilised fashion"" if EU member states broke EU rules. But the three countries argue their actions are in the interests of their economies. ""The ban covers four cereals, but also at my request, at the request of farmers, the ban has been extended to include meals from these cereals: corn, wheat, rapeseed, so that these products also do not affect the Polish market,"" Polish Agriculture Minister Robert Telus said in a statement posted on Facebook. ""We will extend this ban despite their disagreement, despite the European Commission's disagreement,"" added Polish PM Mateusz Morawiecki. ""We will do it because it is in the interest of the Polish farmer."" Hungary imposed a national import ban on 24 Ukrainian agricultural products, including grains, vegetables, several meat products and honey, according to a government decree published on Friday. Slovakia's agriculture minister followed suit announcing its own grain ban. All three bans only apply to domestic imports and do not affect transit to onward markets. The EU created alternative land routes, so-called Solidarity Lanes, for Ukraine to use to export its grains and oilseeds after Russia backed out of a U.N.-brokered Black Sea grain deal in July that allowed safe passage for the cargo ships. The EU Commission said existing measures would expire as originally planned on Friday after Ukraine agreed to introduce measures such as an export licensing system within 30 days The EU said there was no reason to prolong the ban because the distortions in supply that led to the ban in May had disappeared from the market. The EU said it would not impose restrictions as long as Ukraine exercises effective export controls. Farmers in the five countries neighbouring Ukraine have repeatedly complained about a product glut hitting their domestic prices and pushing them towards bankruptcy. The countries, except Bulgaria, had been pushing for an extension of the EU ban. Bulgaria on Thursday voted to scrap the curbs. Romania's government, which unlike its peers did not issue a unilateral ban before May, said on Friday it ""regretted that a European solution to extend the ban could not be found."" Romania said it would wait for Ukraine to present its plan to prevent a surge of exports before deciding how to protect Romanian farmers. Romania sees over 60% of the alternate flows pass through its territory mainly via the Danube river and its farmers have threatened protests if the ban is not extended. For the last year, Ukraine had moved 60% of its exports through the Solidarity Lanes and 40% via the Black Sea through a U.N. brokered deal that fell apart in July. In August, about 4 million tonnes of Ukraine grains passed through the Solidarity Lanes of which close to 2.7 million tonnes were through the Danube. The Commission wants to increase exports through Romania further but the plan has been complicated by Russian drone attacks on Ukraine's grain infrastructure along the Danube and near the Romanian border.",world
"""Without Context..."": US Cop Who Was Joking About Indian Student's Death","An online petition seeks Daniel Auderer's termination from Seattle Police. The Seattle Police Officers' Guild on Friday came out in defence of its official, who was found making insensitive comments after the death of Indian student Jaahnavi Kandula early this year, saying some viral videos of police actions shared by media fail to explain the full story and context. Ms Kandula, a student at Washington's Northeastern University, was struck by officer Kevin Dave at a pedestrian crossing on the night of January 23, 2023. He was driving at a speed of more than 119 kmh on the way to a report of a drug overdose call. In bodycam footage released on Monday by the Seattle Police Department, Officer Daniel Auderer laughed about the deadly crash and dismissed any implication Dave might be at fault or that a criminal investigation was necessary. In the video, Auderer can be heard saying, ""Yeah, just write a cheque. USD 11,000. She was 26 anyway, she had limited value."" ""The video captures only one side of the conversation. There is much more detail and nuance that has not been made public yet...,"" the Seattle Police Officers Guild said in a statement as it also released a letter written by its officer Auderer in which the latter is saying that he intended the comment as a mockery of lawyers. In the letter dated August 3 to the Office of Police Accountability, Auderer said he laughed at the ridiculousness of how these incidents are litigated and the ridiculousness of how he has watched these incidents play out as two parties bargain over a tragedy. ""At the time I believed the conversation was private and not being recorded. The conversation was also not within the course of my duties,"" he wrote in his letter to Gino Betts, director Office of Police Accountability. ""On January 23, 2023 I was dispatched from home to assist with a fatality collision involving a city vehicle,"" he said. ""While enroute home I called Mike Solan to give him an update regarding what had occurred. The phone call was inadvertently recorded on my BWV which had turned on. The conversation took place in my patrol car. I was the only occupant. During that phone call Mike Olan stated something to the effect that it was unfortunate that this would turn into lawyers arguing 'The value of human life.',"" he wrote. ""Mike Solan asked me as he was lamenting the loss of life something similar to: 'What crazy argument can a lawyer make in something like this? What crazy thing can they come up with.' I responded with something like: 'She's 26 years old, what value is there, who cares.' I intended the comment as a mockery of lawyers - I was imitating what a lawyer tasked with negotiating the case would be saying and being sarcastic to express that they shouldn't be coming up with crazy arguments to minimize the payment,"" Auderer wrote. ""I laughed at the ridiculousness of how these incidents are litigated and the ridiculousness of how I have watched these incidents play out as two parties bargain over a tragedy. At the time I believed the conversation was private and not being recorded. The conversation was also not within the course of my duties,"" he said. ""I understand that without context, the comment could be interpreted as horrifying and crude. Without context, the comment is insensitive to the family of the victim when in reality I was involved in a conversation regarding the callousness of the legal system. At the time I had no idea who the victim was,"" he wrote. Auderer said he does understand that if a citizen were to hear it that they would rightfully believe he was being insensitive to the loss of a human life. ""I also understand that if heard it could diminish the trust in the Seattle Police Department and make all of our jobs more difficult. With all of that being said the comment was not made with malice or a hard heart, quite the opposite. ""My intent in requesting rapid adjudication is to be as transparent as possible. I am willing to accept any reasonable discipline our accountability partners and the Chief of Police wish to hand down,"" he said. The Seattle Police Officers' Guild in its statement said some viral videos of police actions shared by media fail to explain the full story/context. ""This Seattle Police video is an example of that reality. The video captures only one side of the conversation. There is much more detail and nuance that has not been made public yet... SPOG has full confidence that the civilian-led police accountability system known as the Office of Police Accountability / OPA will conduct a thorough and fair investigation,"" the guild wrote. Upon being made aware of the existence of this video, Auderer immediately took ownership of his actions and authored a statement requesting that the Director of OPA (Gino Betts) consider the course of ""Rapid Adjudication"", the statement read. ""Rapid Adjudication is a disciplinary process that was agreed to by the City of Seattle and the SPOG to expedite police employee misconduct investigations so accountability can be swiftly addressed, and reasonable discipline imposed. This was done by Dan more than 4 weeks before the release of the video,"" the guild said. Meanwhile, an online petition has been launched and signed by thousands of people seeking to terminate Auderer. ""By allowing Auderer to remain in a position where he interacts with the public, we are putting our community at risk. His actions have shown that he does not prioritize public safety nor respect the rights and dignity of individuals under his jurisdiction,"" said the online petition on Change.org. ~CHECK~Auderer was captured on his body camera making a disturbing statement in the moments following the accident, suggesting that Jaahnavi's life had ""limited value."" When the bodycam footage was leaked this week, several petitions were started on Change.org demanding accountability. ""We call upon Mayor Jenny Durkan, City Council members, and other relevant authorities to prioritize the well-being of our community by addressing these issues promptly. We want justice. Jaahnavi is our daughter, our sister,"" said Nishtha Raheja Goel who launched the online petition. By Friday night, the petition had more than 6,700 signatures. The petitioners urge the authorities responsible for overseeing law enforcement personnel decisions in Seattle to immediately terminate Auderer from his position, conduct thorough background checks during recruitment processes, implement stricter accountability measures within law enforcement agencies and provide comprehensive training on empathy, cultural sensitivity, and appropriate behavior towards victims and their families. ""By taking these actions, we can restore trust in our police force and ensure the safety of all residents in Seattle. Let us stand united against those who abuse their power and demand justice for Jaahnavi Kandula and all victims who have suffered due to Daniel Auderer's actions,"" the petition says. Seattle Councilmember Kshama Sawant in a statement called for an immediate, independent, public investigation into this outrage. ""Auderer, who is the Vice President of the Seattle Police Officers' Guild (SPOG), a deeply reactionary organization which has fought against every measure of police accountability, should be immediately fired. Mike Solan, the President of SPOG, should also be fired from the Seattle Police Department,"" she said. The OPA has failed to hold police accountable, and our city's working people need an independently elected community oversight with full powers over the police, including hiring and firing, and policies and procedures.

"Amid Tensions Over Ukraine, US-Russia Joint Crew Reaches Space Station","The crew docked at the ISS three hours after lifting off from Kazakhstan Two Russian cosmonauts and an American astronaut docked with the International Space Station on Friday after blasting off amid raging tensions between Moscow and Washington over Ukraine. Earlier Friday Roscosmos cosmonauts Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub and NASA astronaut Loral O'Hara lifted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan aboard the Soyuz MS-24 spacecraft. The crew docked at the ISS three hours later, the Russian space agency said. At the orbiting station, the trio will join three Russians, two Americans, a Japanese astronaut and a representative of the European Space Agency. The liftoff took place after Russia's first lunar mission in nearly 50 years failed last month. The ISS is a rare venue for cooperation between the United States and Russia, whose ties broke down after Moscow unleashed its offensive in Ukraine last year. Kononenko alluded to the tensions during a pre-flight press conference on Thursday, saying that ""unlike on earth"" cosmonauts and astronauts took care of each other in space. ""We hear each other there, and we understand each other, and we are very sensitive to our relationships,"" he said. ""We always take care of each other."" O'Hara praised the station's ""legacy"" and said it had been bringing the countries together. ""I'm excited to get on board and see the crewmates who are waiting for us,"" she added. Kononenko, 59, and Chub, 39, were scheduled to spend a year on the ISS, while O'Hara, 40, was to spend six months aboard. It was the first mission to space for both O'Hara and Chub. Chub said that travelling to space was his ""childhood dream"" and he had dedicated ""all his life"" to reaching that goal. The three take over from Russians Dmitry Petelin and Sergey Prokopyev, as well as NASA astronaut Frank Rubio, who have spent one year aboard the ISS. While that trio was initially supposed to return in March, their mission had to be extended after their vessel, the Soyuz MS-22, suffered a coolant leak following damage from a suspected tiny meteoroid. They will now return to Earth on the MS-23, according to Roscosmos. Russian President Vladimir Putin is looking to strengthen space cooperation with China as Western condemnation and sanctions over Moscow's offensive in Ukraine intensify. On Wednesday, Putin hosted the reclusive leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un, at the new Vostochny spaceport in Russia's Far East region, and the two discussed the possibility of sending a North Korean into space. Last month, Russia's Luna-25 module crashed on the Moon's surface after an incident during pre-landing manoeuvres, in a huge embarrassment for Moscow. The mission was meant to mark Russia's return to independent lunar exploration in the face of financial troubles and corruption scandals, and its growing isolation from the West.

"""Unacceptable"": Google Asked To Pay $155 Million Over Location Tracking","Last year, Google agreed to pay $391.5 million to resolve similar allegations Google agreed to pay $155 million to settle claims by California and private plaintiffs that the search engine company misled consumers about how it tracks their locations, and used their data without consent. Both settlements resolve claims that the Alphabet Inc unit deceived people into believing they maintained control over how Google collected and used their personal data. The company was accused of being able to ""profile"" people and target them with advertising even if they turned off their ""Location History"" setting, and deceive people about their ability to block ads they did not want. ""Google was telling its users one thing--that it would no longer track their location once they opted out--but doing the opposite and continuing to track its users' movements for its own commercial gain,"" California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement. ""That's unacceptable."" The California settlement requires Google to pay $93 million, and disclose more about how it tracks people's whereabouts and uses data it collects. Money from Google's $62 million settlement with private plaintiffs would, after deducting legal fees, go to court-approved nonprofit groups that track internet privacy concerns. Lawyers for the plaintiffs said this made sense because it was ""infeasible"" to distribute money to the approximately 247.7 million U.S. adults with mobile devices. Some critics say this type of settlement, known as ""cy pres,"" offers little benefit to class members. Google denied liability, and both settlements require court approval. Last November, Google agreed to pay $391.5 million to resolve similar allegations by 40 U.S. states. The Mountain View, California-based company has also reached $124.9 million of settlements with Arizona and Washington. A spokesperson for Google on Friday referred to a blog post discussing the multistate settlement, and said it related to ""outdated product policies that we changed years ago.""

Netizens Left Emotional As Mumbai’s Iconic Red Double-Decker Buses Leave The Streets After 80 Years Of Service,"The city of Mumbai is bidding a heartfelt farewell to its beloved red double-decker buses, an integral part of its public transportation for more than eight remarkable decades. As these iconic buses reach the end of their 15-year operational life, the Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking has announced that they will permanently cease operations on September 15th, marking the conclusion of an era. These charming buses, with their distinctive appearance and towering presence, have been a source of pride for Mumbaikars. They have not only served as a means of transportation but have also etched their presence into the cultural fabric of the city. Additionally, the open-deck double-decker buses, cherished by tourists for scenic city tours since the 1990s, will also retire from service on October 5th. Amidst the nostalgia and sadness that this decision has stirred among the people of Mumbai, there is a concerted effort by commuter groups and bus enthusiasts to preserve the legacy of these iconic vehicles. They have appealed to the Maharashtra Chief Minister, Tourism Minister, and the BEST administration to ensure that at least two of these iconic buses find a new home at the Anik depot-based museum. Mumbai stands alone as the only Indian city with a significant fleet of double-decker buses in public service. These buses have a storied history dating back to 1937 when they were first introduced to the city's public transport system. Over time, they have transcended being mere vehicles and have become a symbol of Mumbai's identity, even making appearances on the silver screen in Bollywood movies set in the bustling metropolis. I consider it my good fortune to have travelled in trams in my childhood. Such a contrast to the stress of booking Ola cabs! A/C double decker mein woh maaza nahi hai? Mumbai's Iconic BEST bus ferrying between Andheri-Seepz for one last time. Today is the last day of Non AC double decker buses by in Mumbai. I used the same bus route no 415 for over 4 years for my college and Job. ??? While the decision to retire these buses has been influenced by factors like the scarcity of spare parts, high operating costs, and fuel consumption, the BEST has taken steps to replace them with leased battery-run double-decker buses that meet modern environmental standards. As Mumbai continues to evolve, so does its transportation landscape. The red double-decker buses may soon fade from the city's streets, but their memory and legacy will forever live on in the hearts of Mumbaikars and visitors, serving as a reminder of the city's rich history and enduring charm.",entertainment
"SEBI Imposes Fine Worth Rs 2.46 Crore On Two Companies, Seven Individuals For Flouting Regulatory Norms","The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has levied penalties worth Rs 2.46 crore on two companies and seven individuals for violating regulatory norms. The markets regulator barred Girish Talwalkar, Prashant Talwalkar, Madhukar Talwalkar, Vinayak Gawande, Anant Gawande, Harsha Bhatkal, and Girish Nayak for varying periods. The companies include Talwalkars Better Value Fitness Ltd. (TBVFL) and Talwalkars Healthclubs Ltd. (THL), reported PTI. The regulator levied penalties for flouting disclosure norms and PFUTP (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices), it revealed in two separate orders. While Girish Talwalkar, Prashant Talwalkar, Anant Gawande, and Harsha Bhatkal have received a fine of Rs 36 lakh each from the regulator, Rs 24 lakh fine has been imposed on Vinayak Gawande and Madhukar Talwalkar, and a fine of Rs 12 lakh has been levied on THL. TBVFL has been slapped with a fine of Rs 24 lakh and Girish Nayak has been asked to pay a fine of Rs 18 lakh. With regards to TBVFL, Sebi also imposed a securities market ban on Girish Talwalkar, Prashant Talwalkar, Madhukar Talwalkar, Vinayak Gawande, Anant Gawande, Harsha Bhatkal, and Girish Nayak for 18 months and restricted them from being associated with any listed company or any intermediary registered with Sebi for the same time period. The regulator also banned Girish Talwalkar, Prashant Talwalkar, Anant Gawande, Harsha Bhatkal and, Girish Nayak from the market for 18 months with regards to THL and the debarment will start after the expiration of the period of restraints levied on the individuals and company in case of TBVFL. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); Sebi received various complaints against the two companies in 2019 from August to October period. The complaints alleged a default in interest payment on term loans in spite of a significant cash balance. According to the results of the companies for the financial year ending March 2019, both TBVFL and THL reported a total cash balance of around Rs 77 crore and the total default on interest payment stood at Rs 3.5 crore (term loan), as of July 2019. This created a doubt about the validity of their account books. After it’s preliminary examination, the regulator initiated a detailed investigation and KPMG was named the forensic auditor to assist the investigating authority in conducting an examination of the account books for both companies for a period of four fiscal years from 2016-17 to 2019-20. Post this, Sebi began an inquiry into the companies on the suspicion that their financials were being misrepresented to paint a healthy picture in front of the investors. In it’s order, the regulator found that both companies misreported their financial statements by inflating their bank balance, revenue, advances given to connected companies without rationale, and much more. Sebi's Executive Director, V S Sundaresan, noted in two separate orders, “I find that an act of concealment of information related to mis-utilisation of funds by a listed company, which if disclosed would have the potential to impact the share price of that listed company, is undoubtedly fraudulent and unfair trade practice relating to the securities market and covered under the PFUTP Regulations. I am of the view that by disseminating financial statements through the platform of stock exchanges(s) or otherwise, THL and TBVFL has attempted to demonstrate a rosy picture of its affairs, which was clearly misleading and was designed to influence the decisions of the investors dealing in its securities and thereby likely to induce sale and/or purchase in its securities, and thus, in effect has violated the PFUTP Regulations.” Also Read : Government Increases Windfall Tax On Domestic Crude, Reduces Duty On Diesel, ATF Exports",business

This hike takes the duty on crude petroleum to Rs 10,000 per tonne and will come into effect from September 16, the official release from the finance ministry noted. The government also reduced the SAED or duty on the export of diesel from the current rate of Rs 6 per litre to Rs 5.50 per litre. Additionally, duty on jet fuel or ATF has also been reduced to Rs 3.5 per litre from Rs 4 per litre. However, the SAED on petrol will continue to be nil, reported PTI. This decision will increase the windfall tax on domestically produced crude oil which was set at Rs 6,700 per tonne. Crude oil prices have been on the rise for the past three weeks and the Brent crude benchmark crossed the $94 per barrel mark on Friday. This development will impact oil exploration companies. The government hiked special additional excise duty (SAED) on crude petroleum to Rs 10,000 per tonne from today. The windfall tax on domestically produced crude oil was set at Rs 6,700/tonne.

The tax rates are reviewed every two weeks on the basis of average oil prices in the previous two weeks. The government imposes tax on windfall profits of oil producers once they get a price above the ceiling of $75 per barrel. The tax on fuel exports is decided on the basis of margins earned by refiners on overseas shipments. These margins reflect the difference between the international oil price realised and the cost. The government has managed to collect nearly Rs 40,000 crore in SAED imposed on crude oil production and petroleum products exports since July last year. A windfall tax represents a higher tax imposed by the government on certain industries when they report above-average and unexpected profits. The government announced a cut in the windfall tax earlier this year in May when it reduced the tax on crude petroleum to zero.

Kat Alano on her talk at TEDxHyderabad,"Filipino British artist and former MTV VJ and TEDx speaker Kat Alano will be in Hyderabad for the first time as a speaker at TEDxHyderabad. This former showbusiness personality has taken the issue of rape culture in the industry in Philipines head on. A survivor of sexual assault, Kat uses her voice to create a safer world for victims by reassuring them that it is not their fault. Speaking over the telephone from the Philippines Kat says “When a person is raped, only the ‘predator’ and ‘prey’ know what happens behind the closed door. And it is alright for the victim to feel strange and confused. That’s what happened to me. I was 19 years old when I was drugged and raped. I didn’t even know what happened. I decided to keep quiet because I didn’t want anyone to take pity on me. I kept it a secret even from my closest friends. It took me nine years to process my thoughts and to finally gather the courage to speak up.” Kat says she regrets she kept quiet about what happened. “Later when others started to speak up, I felt guilty. Because my silence made the predator more confident. Had I spoken out about my rape, many others would have been spared.” But finally, when she spoke up she decided to be the courage for those who needed it the most. She says her talk resonates with her audience. It is not just about rape, “Women in show business need to be protected. They also get violated, and as women we need to stand in solidarity. They thought of themselves as being damaged or dirty, or were being blamed for the crime against them. We need to allow people to process their thoughts and decide how hurt they feel. Ignoring and remaining silent will only increase the list of women who are violated.” Kat says that she has been able to speak and connect with people from various parts of the world on this [the issue of rape]. Which, according to her, only goes on to show that a lot of help is needed in the world. “We must learn to listen, sympathise and feel their agony because apart from the victim no one really understands what one goes through after rape. We only think about the physical violation, not much thought is given to the mental state,” added Kat. Kat will be in Hyderabad on Sunday (September 17, 2023) for her talk at TEDxHyderabad as one the speakers at Pradhan Conventions. The event starts at 9am.",entertainment
"13,000 Auto Workers Are Striking In US: Here Is All You Need To Know About This Historical Walkout","Auto workers in the US Midwest have started a targeted strike against three big car manufacturers General Motors (GM), Ford, and Stellantis. The workers are demanding better pay and benefits, much of which they gave up at a time when firms were in financial trouble. At the stroke of midnight on Friday, the US auto workers' union United Auto Workers (UAW) started the precise strike strategy, causing simultaneous shutdowns at the ""Big Three"" automotive manufacturers in Detroit, Michigan for the very first time. According to an AFP report, about 13,000 workers walked off the job at a GM assembly plant in Wentzville, Missouri; a Ford factory in Wayne, Michigan, near Detroit; and a Stellantis Jeep plant in Toledo, Ohio. With honking and cheers union workers marched at a Ford plant in the Detroit area with UAW president Shawn Fain. ""Tonight, for the first time in our history, we will strike all three of the Big Three at once,"" said UAW President Shawn Fain. Let's take a look into why this happened and what kind of impact can this kind of a strike leave. Here Is How It Started The issue between the auto workers union UAW and three big carmakers is over a new contract. Every 4 years, the UAW negotiates a new master agreement on behalf of nearly 150,000 members working at General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis (formerly known as Chrysler), according to a Washington Post report. The old contract expired on September 14 and with no agreement, the UAW started the strikes. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); The WP report noted that under the traditional negotiation pattern of UAW, one of the three automakers is selected as the initial negotiation target, and the agreement reached with them serves as a template for the other two companies. This year's negotiations came as GM and Stellantis posted record profits, while Ford also enjoyed healthy financial results. The auto workers want to get a part of these profits. How Much Pay Raise Workers Are Deamding? As per the WP report, initially, the UAW requested a 40 per cent increase in compensation for their hourly workforce over the course of the four-year agreement, which equates to a 46 per cent rise when compounded. However, this was later reduced to 36 per cent. As of now, full-time UAW employees start at a wage of $18 per hour and reach a maximum of around $32 per hour. The union's goal is to narrow the gap between starting and top-tier pay rates. Additionally, in response to the sky-high inflation, the UAW seeks to reinstate a cost-of-living allowance (COLA) linked to inflation, a benefit that they gave up in 2007. They are also advocating for a reduction in the use of temporary workers and a faster path for these employees to attain full pay and benefits. The UAW is also demanding the restoration of other benefits that their members lost in the years leading up to the 2009 recession when GM and Chrysler filed for bankruptcy and received government bailouts. According to Fain, these concessions laid the groundwork for the companies to achieve record profits over the past decade. The demands from the union encompass the revival of traditional pensions and retiree healthcare, along with a reduction in the workweek from 40 to 32 hours. Unionisation Of EV Workers The shift to electric vehicles (EVs), which require fewer components and less labor compared to gasoline-powered vehicles, is expected to result in the closure of plants producing engine parts for traditional cars. As consumers progressively embrace EVs, the US automakers are investing substantial sums in partnerships with Asian firms to construct battery manufacturing plants in the US, as batteries are a key component of EVs. As per the report, key areas of contention between the union and automakers involve the compensation and benefits of workers in these new facilities and whether the UAW can represent them. To date, only the Ultium plant in Ohio, jointly owned by GM and South Korea's LG Energy Solution, is unionised. The initial pay rate there was $15.50 per hour, but following a ratified agreement last month, wages have increased by $3 to $4 per hour, along with retroactive pay dating back to the union election in December, potentially resulting in significant sums for some workers. According to an Associated Press report, the UWA President has acknowledged that the union's demands are ""audacious."" But he said that the richly profitable automakers can afford to raise workers' pay significantly to make up for what the union gave up to help the companies withstand the 2007-2009 financial crisis and the Great Recession. The report added that in the last ten years, the three major Detroit automakers have transformed into highly profitable entities, amassing a total net income of $164 billion, with $20 billion of that earned in the current year. The CEOs of these companies each receive multimillion-dollar annual compensation packages. What Car Makers Are Offering? Reports suggest the automakers have come closer to what UAW is demanding in terms of wages, but a big gap still remains. In an interview with CNN, GM CEO Mary Barra said that they are ready to offer a 20 per cent wage increase, including 10 per cent in the first year, over four years. Ford is also offering 20 per cent pay increase, while Stellantis (formerly Fiat Chrysler) initially proposed 17.5 per cent but has since adjusted its offer. The car companies reject the union's demands, citing excessive costs. They argued that they're investing heavily in both traditional combustion-engine vehicles and electric vehicles, making higher labor costs unsustainable, reports added. They also contend that a generous UAW contract would raise vehicle prices, potentially making Detroit automakers less competitive against European and Asian rivals. The AP report noted that analysts say, including wages and benefits, Detroit Three assembly plant workers receive around $60 per hour, compared to $40 to $45 per hour for workers at Asian automaker plants in the US. Also Read: SEBI Imposes Fine Worth Rs 2.46 Crore On Two Companies, Seven Individuals For Flouting Regulatory Norms The Targeted Strike And Way Forward Only a small part of the United Auto Workers, about 150,000 members initiated walkouts at select plants including a GM assembly plant in Wentzville, Missouri, a Ford factory in Wayne, Michigan, near Detroit, and a Stellantis Jeep plant in Toledo, Ohio. These strikes commenced at 11:59 PM Eastern time on Thursday. UAW President Shawn Fain said these targeted strikes are a means to gain leverage in contract negotiations and to keep the auto companies uncertain about the union's next moves. Additionally, this strategic action may prolong the union's $825 million strike fund. As per a report by AlJzeera, Fain said that, at present, the union does not intend to initiate a more extensive general strike. However, he made it clear that all possibilities remain open, should new contracts fail to be reached. The UAW might select additional plants for strikes in the coming days, depending on the progress—or lack thereof—at the bargaining table, the UAW president stated. ""If the companies continue to bargain in bad faith or continue to stall or continue to give us insulting offers, then our strike is going to continue to grow,"" Fain said, adding that the union ""will keep the companies guessing."" Amid this, US President Joe Biden has come out in support of the strikers saying he ""respects workers right to collective action."" After negotiations broke down, the UAW announced a targeted strike at a few Big 3 auto plants. No one wants a strike, but I respect workers' right to collective action. Workers deserve to share in the benefits they helped create for an enterprise. pic.twitter.com/zlnvnYVvao — President Biden (@POTUS) September 15, 2023 How The Strike May Impact Car Prices And Economy According to the AP report, GM, Ford, and Stellantis have been running factories non-stop to build up inventory, but they only have a 70-day supply of vehicles. A strike could lead buyers to non-union competitors, worsening the shortage in an already chip-constrained market. A strike, particularly in the US Midwest, where most auto plants are located, could have significant economic repercussions. The auto industry contributes about 3 per cent to the US GDP, with Detroit automakers representing a major share of the US car market. Workers on strike would receive $500 a week in strike pay, far less than their regular wages, impacting the economy. The automakers would also suffer substantial financial losses, with a 10-day strike estimated to cost them nearly a billion dollars, based on calculations by the Anderson Economic Group, the report said. Notably, in 2019, a 40-day UAW strike cost GM alone $3.6 billion. Car loan Information: Calculate Car Loan EMI",business

India's Loss To Bangladesh Robs Team A Shot At This No. 1 Ranking Feat,"The Asia Cup's Super Four defeat against Bangladesh cost India a golden chance to rule the rankings charts across formats. Before the Asia Cup clash against Bangladesh on Friday, 15 September, India held the No.2 position on the ICC Men's ODI Team Rankings with 116 rating points, just slightly trailing top-ranked Australia, who led with 118 points. India, currently dominating the Test and T20I rankings, had a golden opportunity to claim the top spot in ODIs if two conditions had been met: defeating Bangladesh in the Super Four clash of the Asia Cup and having South Africa emerge victorious against top-ranked Australia in the penultimate ODI of their five-match series. However, only one of the two scenarios went India's way with the Proteas claiming a massive 164-run victory over Australia while India suffered a narrow defeat against Bangladesh, falling short by just six runs. The loss to Bangladesh not only resulted in India missing out on a chance of holding the pole position across formats, but they slipped to No.3 in the rankings table with a 114 rating behind Pakistan and Australia. Both, Australia and Pakistan are currently separated by a narrow rating margin with Australia having a rating of 115.259 and Pakistan on No.2 with a rating of 114.889. Even if Australia lose their final ODI to South Africa and India become the Asia Cup champions on Sunday (September 17), India will still not claim the No.1 ranking. However, in such a scenario where Australia lose, it would open the door for Pakistan to ascend to the top spot. The tussle for the top spot will continue as India host Australia in a three-match ODI series starting 22 September. The series will not only help the two teams build momentum going into the World Cup but also decide who will be the #1 ODI side going into the World Cup. It has been a scramble at the top of the ODI Team Rankings lately with India, Pakistan and Australia all in contention for the top spot during the Asia Cup and Australia's ODI series against South Africa. Pakistan, who went on top of the rankings after their 3-0 whitewash over Afghanistan in late August, lost their No.1 spot after crushing defeats to India and Sri Lanka in the Asia Cup.

"Watch - ""Gift That Keeps On Giving"": Bizarre Run Out Leaves Internet Abuzz","The European Cricket Series (ECS) often produces moments that rarely occur in any other franchise based league or international cricket. The latest installment from ECS is a testament to that statement. During an ECS Italy T10 game between Asian Latina and Royal Roma, a bizarre run out turned out to be the deciding factor in the match. With Asian Latina needing two runs in one ball, the batters attempt to force a tie led to heartbreak, handing Royal Roma a narrow one-run win. Umar Shahzad, who had the ball in his hands for the final over, bowled a wide ball, bringing the equation down to two in one ball. Shahzad went for the same line on the next delivery in order to stop Khan Saleem, the batter on strike, from making a clean connection with the ball. Saleem had a full swing at it but failed to touch the ball. The batters tried to force a draw by sneaking in bye, but the keeper's was up to the task. He aerially underarmed the ball towards the bowler. However, the ball went throw the legs of the bowler, only to hit the stumps after a deflection. Saleem was caught well short by the bizarre turn of events as Asian Latina lost the match by one run. Even the commentators couldn't believe what just unfolded in front of their eyes. The incident has now gone viral on social media. NO WAY THIS HAPPENED! With only 1% chance of winning at six over mark to losing by just 1 run, Asian Latina had their heart broken in the most bizarre way ever. #EuropeanCricket #EuropeanCricketSeries #StrongerTogether pic.twitter.com/sOie0DXemP Here are some of the reactions: Euro Cricket is the best cricket.

Injured Shoulder Likely To Force Naseem Shah Out Of ICC Cricket World Cup,"Pakistan pacer Naseem Shah's recent shoulder injury has cast doubts over his participation in the forthcoming World Cup, set to be held in India next month.

""This is an age-old problem. India are playing in Asia Cup, I've seen changes in almost every game in their team. They've rested seniors, played juniors, it shows that they are preparing for the World Cup. These decisions are very important, you select a 15-member squad because the players are bench are as good as those in XI. You shouldn't have a problem with resting the first-choice players,"" Afridi said on Samaa TV. ""If Shadab is rested, Osama Mir is there. He has performed well for Pakistan in the past. If someone isn't performing in quite some matches, you should rest him. I'm not saying that drop him from the 15-member squad, you can keep him in the team and still rest him.

"""Good Workout"" For India: On Bangladesh Loss, Shastri's Big Observation","Former India head coach Ravi Shastri opened up on the Rohit Sharma -led side's shock defeat to Bangladesh in the Asia Cup Super 4 clash on Friday. Shastri feels India let the game slip out of their grasp by allowing Bangladesh to score extra 50 to 60 runs. Bangladesh were reeling at 59 for 4 at one stage before making a strong recovery to post 265 for 8. Speaking of the defeat, Shastri feels it's a great learning curve for the team ahead of Sunday's final against Sri Lanka at the same venue. ""Firstly, think we let them score 50-60 extra runs. The kind of position they were in, we shouldn't have allowed them to score more than 180. Secondly, this is a good work out for India. Forget about the result as they will play the final. They were batting for the first time under lights. It was a different challenge for the batters with the ball moving,"" Shastri said on Star Sports. Shastri was all praise for Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan for utilising his resources, adding that they have a strong spin attack. ""For Shubman Gill , this is a big step. He took his time and scored a hundred. Plus, Bangladesh's spin attack is a good one. They took two early wickets with the pacers but the match started after they introduced spin. It's not easy to score between 15-40 overs. Shakib is a smart captain who knows how to marshal his spinners,"" he added. Rohit's India face Sri Lanka in Sunday's Asia Cup final, a crucial momentum-builder heading into next month's ODI World Cup. The cricketing giants have 13 Asian titles between them and Sri Lanka have a history of sneaking into the tournament's final -- to the consternation of fans keen for any showdown between arch-rivals India and Pakistan. Sri Lanka, who won the previous edition of the Asia Cup played in the T20 format, came in as underdogs and snuck into the Super Fours with a dramatic win over Afghanistan.

India's Golden Generation Of Squash Ready For Last Dance At Asian Games,"Saurav Ghosal, Joshna Chinappa and Dipika Pallikal, synonymous with Indian squash over the past two decades, have unfinished business going into what could be their last appearance at the Asian Games. Ghosal and Joshna, who both turned 37 recently, will be featuring in their sixth Asian Games, a testament to their remarkable longevity in a physically demanding sport like squash. A week way from celebrating her 32nd birthday, Dipika will be entering her fourth and in all probability last Asian Games. The mother of two, who doesn't play singles anymore, will be eyeing a mixed doubles gold alongside Harinder Pal Sandhu in Hangzhou. Ghosal and Joshna too are in the twilight or their careers and Hangzhou could be their one final chance to add a singles gold to the rich medal count at the continental event, having won seven and four medals respectively since their maiden outing in 2002. Though the level at Asian Games is not as high as the Commonwealth Games, the job for Ghosal and Joshna will be far from easy. Ghosal targets elusive singles gold The psychological wounds of a heartbreaking loss in the men's singles final at the 2014 Incheon edition remain fresh in Ghosal's mind as the veteran athlete goes into the Games once again as the favourite for the gold medal. Leading 2-0 and a match ball in the third game, he had the gold very much in sight until Abdullah Al Muzayen from Kuwait bounced back from nowhere to stage a winning comeback. Ghosal is not bitter about that loss but remains determined to win the gold. ""When I started back then, never thought I would go on to play in six Asian Games. Representing India has been the biggest honour. ""In terms of highs and lows, the biggest high was 2014 when we won the team gold for the first time and biggest low was also the 2014 silver. Advertisement ""Winning the first bronze in 2006 will always be special. The gold is obviously the target this time as I have not done it yet,"" said Ghosal, who won a historic bronze in Commonwealth Games last year. The Indian is seeded second in the singles behind Malaysia's Eain Yow Ng, an opponent 12 years younger to him. Ghosal, who is currently the highest-ranked player in Asia at 17, will also need to be wary of his rivals from Pakistan, Kuwait and Hong Kong. Abdullah, the 2014 gold medallist, is also part of the draw. Ghosal is drawn to meet world number 19 Yow in the final and if that does happen, he will go into the contest high on confidence having beaten the much younger Malaysian in five games in Paris last month. Can Joshna go all the way too? While Ghosal has had a steady run ahead of the Games, Joshna goes into the competition following an injury-marred year that saw the former world number 10 drop to as low as 71 in the PSA rankings. In fact, Tanvi Khanna is now the highest ranked Indian woman at 70. Having regained full fitness ahead of the mega event, Joshna will have a point to prove and change the colour of the singles medal she secured in Jakarta five years ago. The bronze in the 2018 edition was her first in singles event, following her three medals in team events. Her main rivals in the competition include top seed Satomi Watanbe of Japan and Ho Tze Lok of Hong Kong. Joshna may not have had the best of year leading up to the Games but trust her to bring her A game to the fore, like she had done in the 2018 edition when she stunned eight-time world champion Nicol David in the team events to script a silver for India. Dipika favourite for mixed doubles gold Dipika and her mixed doubles partner Sandhu had the opportunity to take part in the Asian Games test event in Hangzhou three months ago and they made the most of it by winning the gold. Training at the Indian Squash Academy in Chennai under the eyes of former world champions Gregory Gaultier and James Willstrop, the Indian duo is giving finishing touches to its preparation. The Games are expected to be Dipika's swansong and she is giving her all on the training front to make it a memorable affair. India ended with five medals in Jakarta (four bronze and one silver) and they are looking to better that performance in China.

'Winning Asia Cup is important for World Cup': Shubman Gill emphasises on continental success ahead of WC 2023,"The Indian Cricket team will be facing defending champions Sri Lanka in the final of the Asia Cup 2023 on Sunday, September 17. The Men in Blue will look to get their hands on the Asian trophy after missing out on the trophy match last year in the 20-over version. The tournament win will provide 's men with the much-needed momentum heading into the home World Cup and opening batter acknowledged it. Indian opener Gill has stated that winning the Asia Cup will be important in giving the team the confidence and the momentum required for the World Cup. He highlighted that the team needs to create a winning habit and will look to peak at the right time with the 50-over marquee tournament coming ahead. ""Winning the (Asia Cup) final is very important for us because we need to create a winning habit. Peaking at the right time and gaining momentum at the right time is important,"" Friday's century-maker Gill said in a post-match press conference after India's close loss to Bangladesh. ""It is also important to maintain that momentum because losing in one or two matches can add pressure. Winning here will give us a lot of momentum and confidence going into the World Cup,"" he added. India suffered their first loss in the Asia Cup and they were the last team to get beaten in the tournament. But the right-handed batter brushed away any such doubts. I don't think we have lost any momentum. I think we gave away extra 10-15 runs to their (Bangladesh) lower-order batters, but that apart we played some good cricket. But these things happen on such kinds of wickets. Hopefully, we can execute these lessons in the final (of Asia Cup) and in the World Cup,"" the 24-year-old added. The right-handed batter also admitted that Sri Lanka have momentum with them and the Indian team will have to be at its best to down the defending champions. ""I think they (SL) have great momentum with them. The way they won the last match (against Pakistan) was great to see. We will have to pull up our socks, and we have to be at our 100 per cent to beat them,” he said. Indian batters have struggled against the spin and slow surfaces, as seen in the match against Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Gill saw these pitches as a good preparation ahead of the World tournament. ""It is a great practice for batsmen and bowlers because these are the kind of pitches that we generally play in India. Playing on these wickets against good teams against good oppositions under pressure will definitely help us in the World Cup,"" he said.",sports
"""Will Be Dangerous..."": Shakib Fires World Cup Warning After Beating India","Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan feels that the Tigers will be a ""dangerous side"" for the upcoming ODI World Cup after they ended their Asia Cup campaign with a remarkable 6-run victory over India at the R Premadasa Stadium. India walked in as the only team who managed to remain unbeaten throughout the competition. Shubman Gill's 121 and Axar Patel's valiant 42 almost took the entire game away from Bangladesh. But the Tigers dug deep to clinch an exceptional victory and end their tournament on a high note. Shakib played a crucial hand in Bangladesh's victory and after the match, he sent a strong message to other teams, ""I think we will be a dangerous side in the World Cup."" He further went on to reflect on his performance and other players who played a crucial role in keeping the momentum in their favour. ""Yes, we gave the guys a chance who haven't played much. After the last couple of games here, we thought spinners will do well. Today, I went early and had time to spend on the crease. It was a challenging wicket. It was seaming a bit and it got easier when the ball got older. (On Mahedi Hasan) It wasn't an easy time to bowl, he came to bowl and got us the breakthrough. He also bowled five overs at the end which is not easy for a spinner. Also, Tanzim bowled well at the start and took two wickets. We have got a very good team. A lot of players injured and some going in and out, that didn't help us,"" Shakib said. Coming to the match, Gill played a thunderous knock of 121 off 133 while Axar scored a vital 42 off 34 deliveries. For Bangladesh, Mustafizur Rahman bagged three while Tanzim Hasan Sakib scalped 2 wickets. Shakib Al Hasan and Towhid Hridoy shone brightly, both scoring remarkable half-centuries, while the Bangladesh pacers demonstrated their mettle with great precision in their deliveries to successfully defend the total of 265.

'Not Taking Any Wicket': Babar's Honest Verdict On Star Spinner Shadab,"Kusal Mendis ' 91 and an unbeaten 49 by Charith Asalanka helped Sri Lanka eliminate Pakistan with a two-wicket win in a last-ball thriller of the Asia Cup 2023. With the win, Sri Lanka set up a final clash with India while Babar Azam and company were left heartbroken. Chasing a DLS revised target of 252 in the 42-overs-a-side contest in Colombo, Sri Lanka needed eight from the final over and achieved the target with Asalanka's winning hit on the last ball. Among the players who underperformed for Pakistan in the tournament was their star spinner Shadab Khan . The bowler started the tournament with a four-wicket haul against Nepal but failed to carry on the impressive performance in the following games. Shadab remained wicketless in the next two games. Across three matches in the Super 4 stage, he could clinch only two wickets. His dip in form was one of the key factors that led to Pakistan's poor performance in their last two Super 4 matches. ""Shadab is bowling very well but he is not taking any wicket. So that's why you feel he is not bowling well. He is bowling well by unfortunately he is not taking any wickets. He is one of your best bowlers, Nawaz and Shadab"", said Pakistan skipper Babar. Talking about Pakistan's do-or-die match against Sri Lanka, left-handed Asalanka held his nerve despite Shaheen Shah Afridi's two wickets in two balls in the penultimate over and the first four balls from Zaman Khan giving away just two runs and a wicket in the 42nd over. Mendis set up victory with a 100-run third-wicket stand with Sadeera Samarawickrama, who made 48, but Asalanka took it on himself after their departure. Earlier Mohammad Rizwan hit an unbeaten 86 to steer Pakistan to 252 for 7 after they elected to bat first in the rain delayed start to the match. Sri Lanka's bowlers took regular early wickets to check Pakistan's scoring, but Rizwan hit back with his 12th ODI half-century and a 108-run stand with Iftikhar, who made 47.

"Congress slams govt over manner of implementing OROP, alleges 'large-scale anomalies'","Synopsis The Congress party has criticized the Indian government for the implementation of the 'One Rank One Pension' (OROP) policy, stating that it has led to ""large scale anomalies."" The party's Ex-Servicemen Department chief, Col (retd) Rohit Chaudhry, claimed that the OROP scheme has not been implemented as intended by the previous government and that the current form of OROP is not the actual concept envisioned. Representative image. The Congress on Saturday attacked the government over the manner of implementing the 'One Rank One Pension ', saying had it been done in accordance with the letter and spirit of the notification issued during the UPA dispensation, ""large scale anomalies"" wouldn't have crept in. In a statement, Congress' Ex-Servicemen Department chief Col (retd) Rohit Chaudhry said last month Rahul Gandhi drove across Ladakh on a motorcycle, meeting people from all sections of society including ex-servicemen. ""Since he had not been able to cover Ladakh during the Bharat Jodo Yatra , he decided to undertake a separate journey. This is the first time a national leader has covered Ladakh so extensively, and it has sent a strong signal to the Chinese that Ladakh is an integral and inseparable part of India,"" Chaudhry said. ""In a conversation with ex-servicemen, they told him (Gandhi) how wrongly OROP has been implemented, and how the Agnipath scheme is harming the safety security and integrity of the nation and also destroying the future of the youth,"" he said. After completion of four years, Agniveers will neither get any pension nor other benefits and instead, they will again become unemployed, he claimed. Moreover, the employability restrictions imposed on the employment of Agniveers will affect the operational effectiveness of the units and will simultaneously burden the regular soldiers, Chaudhry argued. ""Rahul Gandhi's interaction with ESMs further amplified that OROP, which is equally applicable to all the defence veterans (officers, JCOs and Other Ranks), has not been implemented as envisaged by UPA Govt's order of February 26, 2014, which was passed by both Houses of the Parliament,"" he said. The present form of OROP-1 and 2 is not the actual OROP conceptualised under the UPA regime, but is a ""one rank and many persons"", he said. ""Had OROP been implemented in letter and spirit of UPA's notification, then large-scale anomalies induced in implementation wouldn't have cropped in. While issuing orders for passing OROP-2 on 23 December 2022, under sustained pressure of Bharat Jodo Yatra which was entering Delhi, the Narendra Modi government induced further anomalies by reducing pensions of JCOS and other ranks by a few thousand per month,"" he said. Though no one has got actual OROP, whatever benefits have been passed, they are lesser for JCOS and ORS as per their legitimate right, he said. ""Passing of the reduced benefits, to JCOs and Other Ranks, is causing large-scale heartburn among junior cadres of the defence fraternity which has created a divide among cadres and is not good for the country's defence forces,"" he said. The Congress demands from the Modi government that OROP anomalies should be corrected immediately without any further delay, Chaudhry said. It is the central government which is causing a divide and it is the responsibility of the government to correct its ""follies"", he said. Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

"Yet another hike smashes fuel prices record in Pakistan, prompts furore","Amid double-digit inflation, Pakistan's caretaker government has effected yet another hike in the prices of petrol and diesel taking them to a historic high — over (Pakistani) Rs 330 per litre — prompting immediate protests and a legal challenge too. As on Saturday, $1 was equivalent to 296.41 Pakistani Rupee. The Ministry of Finance on Friday night announced the price hike of petrol by Rs 26.02 and diesel by Rs 17.34 per litre. After the hike, petrol and high-speed diesel (HSD) are costing over Rs 330 at the filling stations, “a psychological barrier that has been crossed for the first time in the country’s history,” the Dawn newspaper wrote. The fuel price hike comes on the heels of over 27.4% increase in the rate of inflation in August, putting an unbearable burden on the masses, as petrol and HSD are used by all private and public service vehicles. The caretaker government on September 1 jacking up the petrol and diesel prices by over Rs 14. The rise is on top of Rs 32.41 and Rs 38.49 per litre increase in petrol and HSD prices since August 15. Petrol and diesel have become costlier by 20% since the caretaker government took over in August. Meanwhile, the hike in the petrol and diesel prices has prompted Pakistan’s opposition parties to vociferously criticise it even as a judicial activist challenged it in the Lahore High Court. Rejecting the massive increase in petroleum prices, Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) announced sit-ins outside the governors’ houses in all four provinces of Pakistan. JI chief Sirajul Haq said the government has made the life of a common man miserable by increasing the petroleum prices on the directions of the IMF, Dunya News channel’s website reported on Saturday. Sardar Abdul Rahim of the Grand Democratic Alliance too rejected the increase as he said that the PDM, i.e. the consortium Pakistan Democratic Movement’s agreement with IMF has “proved to be fatal for Pakistan’s economy.” In Lahore, advocate Azhar Siddique, the head of the Judicial Activism Panel, has filed an application in the Lahore High Court, in which the caretaker federal government has been made a party, Dunya News said in another report. The petitioner pointed out how there was no mechanism to determine the prices of the products and that the increase in prices of petroleum products would lead to a new wave of inflation. Earlier, the Finance Ministry blamed “the increasing trend of petroleum prices in the international market” for revising the existing consumer prices of petroleum products. The government is charging Rs 60 per litre petroleum development levy (PDL) on petrol and Rs 50 each on HSD under the commitment with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In July, the IMF transferred $1.2 billion to cash-strapped Pakistan, part of the $3 billion bailout programme for nine months to support the government’s efforts to stabilise the country's ailing economy. Pakistan’s economy has been in a free fall mode for the last many years, bringing untold pressure on the poor masses in the form of unchecked inflation.",world
Ex-U.S. envoy to Pakistan gets probation for ethics violations,"Richard Olson, a former U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates, was sentenced to three years of probation on Friday for violating federal ethics laws. The 63-year-old Mr. Olson was also fined $93,400 after pleading guilty to charges he misused his official position for personal gain. Mr. Olson, who served as the U.S. envoy to Pakistan from 2012 to 2015, pleaded guilty in June of last year to making a false statement and violating laws governing lobbying for a foreign government. Mr. Olson was accused of helping the government of Qatar influence U.S. policymakers shortly after retiring from the State Department in 2016. ""U.S. law prohibits senior officials — like the defendant — from representing a foreign government before any federal agency or from aiding or advising a foreign entity with the intent to influence the US government for one year after leaving their positions,"" the U.S. Attorney's Office for Washington said in a statement. ""The defendant took numerous steps to conceal these illegal activities, including deleting incriminating emails and lying to the FBI during a recorded interview,"" it said. According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, Mr. Olson, while serving as the U.S. envoy to Pakistan, also received favours and benefits from a Pakistani-American businessman identified in court documents only as ""Person 1."" They included $25,000 paid to Mr. Olson's then-girlfriend to help pay her tuition at Columbia University in New York and $18,000 in first class travel for the ambassador to attend a job interview in London. ""One major favor was that the defendant agreed to lobby members of Congress on Person 1's behalf with respect to weapon sales to Pakistan and Middle Eastern countries that Person 1 was trying to broker,"" the US Attorney's office said. According to The Washington Post , ""Person 1"" is Imaad Zuberi, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 2021 for making illegal campaign contributions and other offenses.",world
"Libya investigates dams’ collapse after flood killed over 11,000","Libyan authorities have opened an investigation into the collapse of two dams that caused a devastating flood in a coastal city as rescue teams searched for bodies on September 16, nearly a week after the deluge killed more than 11,000 people. Heavy rains caused by Mediterranean storm Daniel caused deadly flooding across eastern Libya last weekend. The floods overwhelmed two dams, sending a wall of water several metres high through the centre of Derna, destroying entire neighborhoods and sweeping people out to sea. Also Read | Libya’s flood-ravaged Derna struggles to cope with thousands of corpses More than 10,000 people are missing, according to the Libyan Red Crescent. Six days on, searchers are still digging through mud and hollowed-out buildings, looking for bodies and possible survivors. The Red Crescent has confirmed 11,300 deaths so far. Claire Nicolet, who heads the emergencies department of the Doctors Without Borders aid group, said that rescuers found “a lot of bodies” on Friday and were still searching. “It was a big number ... the sea is still ejecting lots of dead bodies unfortunately,” she told AP . She said major aid efforts were still needed, including urgent psychological support for those who lost their families. She said the burial of bodies is still a significant challenge, despite some progress in coordinating search and rescue efforts and the distribution of aid. Authorities and aid groups have voiced concern about the spread of waterborne diseases and shifting of explosive ordnance from Libya's recent conflicts. Haider al-Saeih, head of Libya’s center for combating diseases, said in televised comments Saturday that at least 150 people had suffered from diarrhea after drinking contaminated water in Derna. He urged residents to only drink bottled water, which is being shipped in as part of relief efforts. Libya's General Prosecutor, al-Sediq al-Sour, said that prosecutors would investigate the collapse of the two dams, which were built in the 1970s, as well as the allocation of maintenance funds. He said prosecutors would investigate local authorities in the city, as well as previous governments. “I reassure citizens that whoever made mistakes or negligence, prosecutors will certainly take firm measures, file a criminal case against him and send him to trial,” he told a news conference in Derna late Friday. Also Read | Libya’s deadly floods: what we know It's unclear how such an investigation can be carried out in the North African country, which plunged into chaos after a NATO-backed uprising toppled longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. For most of the past decade, Libya has been split between rival administrations — one in the east, the other in the west — each backed by powerful militias and international patrons. One result has been the neglect of crucial infrastructure, even as climate change makes extreme weather events more frequent and severe. Jalel Harchaoui, an expert on Libya at the London-based Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies, said that an investigation could pose “a unique challenge” to judicial authorities, since it could lead to the highest ranks of leadership in eastern and western Libya. Since 2014, eastern Libya has been under the control of Gen. Khalifa Hifter and his self-styled Libyan National Army. A rival government, based in the capital, Tripoli, controls most national funds and oversees infrastructure projects. Neither tolerates dissent. “The key challenge to a thorough investigation is the Hifter coalition’s longstanding behaviour; its historic lack of accountability writ large could obstruct the unearthing of truths,” Mr. Harchaoui said. Local officials in the city had warned the public about the coming storm and last Saturday ordered residents to evacuate coastal areas in Derna, fearing a surge from the sea. But there was no warning about the dams, which collapsed early Monday as most residents were asleep in their homes. A report by a state-run audit agency in 2021 said the two dams hadn't been maintained despite the allocation of more than $2 million for that purpose in 2012 and 2013. A Turkish firm was contracted in 2007 to carry out maintainence on the two dams and build another dam in between. The firm, Arsel Construction Company Ltd., said on its website that it completed its work in November 2012. It didn't respond to an email seeking further comment. Local and international rescue teams were meanwhile working around the clock, searching for bodies and potential survivors in the city of 90,000 people. Ayoub said that his father and nephew died in Derna on Monday, a day after the family had fled flooding in the nearby town of Bayda. He said that his mother and sister raced upstairs to the roof but the others didn't make it. “I found the kid in the water next to his grandfather,” said Ayoub, who only gave his first name. ""I am wandering around and I still don’t believe what happened.” Al-Sour, the top prosecutor, called on residents who have missing relatives to report to a forensic committee that works on documenting and identifying retrieved bodies. “We ask citizens to cooperate and quickly proceed to the committee’s headquarters, so that we can finish the work as quickly as possible,” he said. Libyan authorities have restricted access to the flooded city to make it easier for searchers to dig through the mud and hollowed-out buildings for the more than 10,000 people still missing. Many bodies were believed to have been buried under rubble or swept out into the Mediterranean Sea, they said. The storm hit other areas in eastern Libya, including the towns of Bayda, Susa, Marj and Shahatt. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced in the region and took shelter in schools and other government buildings. Dozens of foreigners were among those killed, including people who had fled war and unrest elsewhere in the region. Others had come to Libya to work or were traveling through in hopes of migrating to Europe. At least 74 men from one village in Egypt perished in the flood, as well as dozens of people who had traveled to Libya from war-torn Syria.",world
Manchester City storm back to beat West Ham 3-1,"Jeremy Doku, Bernardo Silva and Erling Haaland scored second-half goals as Manchester City fought back from a goal down to beat West Ham United 3-1 at the London Stadium on Saturday and move back top of the Premier League table. Liverpool's 3-1 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers had taken them to the summit, but City stormed back in the second half of a pulsating game to secure the three points. City should have gone ahead in the seventh minute, but a goal-line clearance by Tomas Soucek and a good save from Alphonse Areola kept the game scoreless. The visitors spurned another great opportunity when Josko Gvardiol whipped a ball across the box but Haaland swept his effort wide of the goal, much to the relief of the flat-footed West Ham defence. After soaking up enormous pressure, the home side took the lead in the 36th minute when Vladimir Coufal chipped a cross to the far post and James Ward-Prowse produced a brilliant diving header. Doku equalised 43 seconds into the second half, running menacingly at Coufal before firing home, and Silva and Haaland were on target in the 76th and 86th minutes to send City back top on 15 points, two ahead of Liverpool. The Hammers did not give up and almost took the lead again on the hour mark when Michail Antonio played in Emerson only for his shot to be blocked by Manuel Akanji and from the resulting corner Ederson pulled off a magnificent save to deny Kurt Zouma. Champions City were not to be denied, however, and in the 76th minute Silva gave them the lead, hooking home a scooped pass from Julian Alvarez before Haaland finally got his goal 10 minutes later to secure the three points. City top the standings on a perfect 15 points from five games, two ahead of Liverpool and three ahead of Brighton & Hove Albion. West Ham drop to sixth on 10 points.",sports
New Zealand's Southee fractures bone to put World Cup in doubt,"New Zealand paceman Tim Southee faces a race against time to be fit for the World Cup after dislocating and fracturing a bone in his right thumb on Friday. Less than three weeks before the start of the World Cup in India, Southee suffered the injury while dropping a catch off England's Joe Root in the final one-day international of the four-match series. Root, who was on eight at the time, edged Ben Lister to Southee in the slips. He immediately looked to be in pain and left the field to go for a scan, failing to return. ""An X-ray has confirmed that Tim Southee dislocated and fractured a bone in his right thumb while attempting to take a catch in the 14th over of the first innings,"" said a New Zealand team spokesman. ""A timeline for his recovery will be established tomorrow when he undergoes further assessment."" New Zealand begin their World Cup campaign against defending champions England in Ahmedabad in the opening game of the tournament on October 5. Southee, 34, named this week in an experienced New Zealand squad for the tournament, had taken 214 wickets in 156 ODIs before Friday's match at Lord's. He bowled four overs for 29 runs on Friday as England scored 311-9 in their 50 overs. New Zealand captain Tom Latham, speaking after England won the match by 100 runs to take the series 3-1, described Southee as a ""resilient character"". ""He's a massive leader among the group and he'll be assessed over the coming days when we get back home to see how bad it is,"" he said. ""Luckily we do have a little bit of time leading into those first couple of games so we'll know a little bit more over the coming days. ""He's a pretty resilient character so I'm sure he'll be doing all he can to be on the plane ready for that first game."" Seamer Lister suffered a hamstring strain, though he was able to bat. Latham said he would know more once the bowler had a scan. ""Fingers crossed it's not too bad for him as well,"" he said.",sports
'Kamal Nath Should Challenge Gandhi Family To...': Smriti Irani In MP Amid Sanatan Dharma Row,"New Delhi: Coming down heavily on the Congress amid the Sanatan Dharma controversy, Union Minister Smriti Irani on Saturday said the upcoming assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh will not be just another election, but a battle between “adharma and dharma” (moral and immoral).

""To show faith in the religion before the election in Chhindwara and inviting a seer at an event is not enough.

Addressing a press conference with AICC in-charge for Madhya Pradesh Randeep Singh Surjewala in Bhopal earlier in the day, Nath said this is not the first time the saffron party is using this ploy. Ahead of the 2019 general elections, too, the BJP had raked up issues like nationalism and surgical strike to divert the people’s attention. “India is a country where a majority of people follow Sanatan Dharma. However, the BJP is trying to divert the attention from real issues and hence brought up the Sanatan Dharma controversy,” news agency PTI quoted Kamal Nath as saying. Addressing a rally in Madhya Pradesh’s Sehore, Irani said, “This is not just an election, it is a fight between Adharma and Dharma. It is a fight between Lord Ram devotees and those who file affidavits that Lord Ram does not exist. This is not an ordinary fight.

One-third of TB patients received no payment for nutrition support,"Undernutrition is the leading risk factor for TB disease. In 2019 , Preeti Sudan, Secretary in the Health Ministry noted letter that undernutrition at the population level contributes to 55% of annual TB incidence in India. A 2022 study noted that 45% of people in India are undernourished, accounting for nearly 1.2 million TB cases each year. Yet, nutrition support became a part of the national TB programme only in April 2018 when Nikshay Poshan Yojana — a direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme for nutritional support to TB patients — was launched. Under this programme, Rs.500 per month is credited into the account of a person with TB for the duration of treatment. (For top health news of the day, subscribe to our newsletter Health Matters) In September 2022, India launched another nutrition support programme called Ni-kshay Mitra to consented TB patients. And in 2022, Tamil Nadu became the first and only State to launch the Differentiated TB Care programme to reduce the mortality rate among TB patients. Severe undernutrition is one of the three parameters used for triaging TB patients at the time of diagnosis. During triaging as part of the Differentiated TB Care programme, it became evident that 52% of notified TB patients in Tamil Nadu had undernutrition, and 25% had severe undernutrition. If undernutrition among TB patients is so high even in Tamil Nadu, the situation might be far worse in many northern States which have higher levels of undernutrition in the general population. All the three initiatives provide nutrition support only to TB patients to reduce mortality and not to the family members also to prevent TB disease. The nutrition status of TB patients at the time of diagnosis is largely a reflection of the family’s nutrition level. The 2017 guidance document on nutritional care and support for patients with TB in India had recommended that the family members are provided with a “food basket as they likely to be food insecure, chronically energy deficient and at high risk of contracting TB”. This is yet to become a reality. The RATIONS trial in Jharkhand has underscored the importance of providing nutrition support to family members to prevent TB disease. In the trial, TB disease among household contacts was prevented in 39% (all forms of TB) to 48% (pulmonary TB) through nutritional support. Nikshay Poshan Yojana As per the India TB report 2023, of the 2.4 million notified TB cases, only 1.6 million (66%) received at least one month’s payment in 2022 under the Ni-kshay Poshan Yojana programme. There has been very little increase in the number of beneficiaries in the last three years. For instance, in 2021, only 62.1% of the 2.1 million notified cases in India received at least one payment. In 2020 too , only 62% of notified TB cases received at least one month payment. In 2022, in Delhi, which has the highest rate of TB burden at nearly 546 cases per 100,000 people, only 44% of beneficiaries received at least one payment. Among the large States, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat had high case notification rates of 218, 214 and nearly 213, respectively. But only 64%, 82%, and 63% of beneficiaries in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat, respectively received at least one payment. A January 2022 retrospective cohort study carried out during January-September 2019 among 426 patients found that the assistance was not reaching the poorest among the poor who need nutritional support the most due to the lack of basic documents. The study also recorded a delay of 56 days to receive the first instalment. Also, 49% of patients received the last instalment after treatment completion. TB patients perceived the assistance provided under the Ni-kshay Poshan Yojana programme was “insufficient to buy nutritious food throughout the course of treatment”.",science
Is it possible to reduce the risk of depression?,"A healthy lifestyle that involves moderate alcohol consumption, a healthy diet, regular physical activity, healthy sleep and frequent social connection, while avoiding smoking and too much sedentary behaviour, reduces the risk of depression, new research has found ( Nature Mental Health ). The researchers looked at a combination of factors including lifestyle factors, genetics, brain structure and our immune and metabolic systems to identify the underlying mechanisms that might explain this link. To better understand the relationship between these factors and depression, the researchers turned to the U.K. Biobank. By examining data from almost 290,000 people — of whom 13,000 had depression — followed over a nine-year period, the team was able to identify seven healthy lifestyle factors linked with a lower risk of depression. Of all of these factors, having a good night’s sleep (seven to nine hours a night) made the biggest difference, reducing the risk of depression by 22%. Frequent social connection, which in general reduced the risk of depression by 18%, was the most protective against recurrent depressive disorder. Moderate alcohol consumption decreased the risk of depression by 11%, healthy diet by 6%, regular physical activity by 14%, never smoking by 20%, and low-to-moderate sedentary behaviour by 13%.",science

It was a statement start for the world’s No 1 team, but the gradient from here is steep. After tonight’s clash with Tonga – who are a tough proposition in their own right – it’s a Tier 1 battle royale for as long as Andy Farrell’s side can stay in the game. South Africa, then Scotland – and if they advance, either France or New Zealand in the quarter-finals. It says something for the threat Tonga pose that despite the looming fixture list, Farrell has gone with a strong team tonight, not willing to run the risk of a slip-up. Like their island neighbours Samoa, Tonga are strengthened by former All Blacks, and have had to wait a full week to make their mark on this tournament. Ireland need only look back to their narrow warm-up win over Samoa to recognise the danger Tonga will pose. There are no more easy games at the World Cup, particularly for Farrell’s trophy chasers. Kick-off is at 8pm (BST) in Nantes.

"Science For Everyone: What Are UFOs? Know Interesting Anecdotes, And How NASA Aims To Track Them","UFOs: Welcome back to ""Science For Everyone"", ABP Live's weekly science column. Last week, we explained why cracking of joints makes noises such as popping, grinding and snapping, and whether repetitive cracking can damage the soft tissues of joints. This week, we discuss what unidentified flying objects (UFOs) are, some interesting anecdotes of these mysterious phenomena, and how NASA aims to track them. UFOs are also known as unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), and are commonly associated with aliens or intelligent life from outer space. NASA on September 14, 2023, commissioned an independent study team to understand UAP, and published a report mentioning how the space agency can contribute to the ongoing efforts of the US government to analyse observations of aerial phenomena that cannot be classified as balloons, aircraft, or as known natural phenomena. NASA also appointed Mark Mclnerney as the director of UAP research. During a press conference held to announce the commissioning of this independent study team, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said, ""This is the first time NASA has taken concrete action to study UAP"". The NASA Chief also said that the study team ""did not find evidence that UAP have an extraterrestrial origin"". Most events were conventional balloons or aeroplanes. However, he said that the study team aims to change the idea of UAPs from ""sensationalism to science"".",world

Wordle today: Here's the answer and hints for September 17,"Ah, Sunday at last! You made it! Celebrate with Wordle #820. As always, we're serving up our daily hints and tips to help you figure out the answer. If you just want to be told today's word, you can jump to the end of this article for September 17's Wordle solution revealed. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you. Originally created by engineer Josh Wardle as a gift for his partner, Wordle rapidly spread to become an international phenomenon, with thousands of people around the globe playing every day. Alternate Wordle versions created by fans also sprang up, including battle royale Squabble , music identification game Heardle , and variations like Dordle and Quordle that make you guess multiple words at once . Wordle eventually became so popular that it was purchased by the New York Times , and TikTok creators even livestream themselves playing . Not the day you're after? Here's the Wordle answer for Sept. 16. The best Wordle starting word is the one that speaks to you. But if you prefer to be strategic in your approach, we have a few ideas to help you pick a word that might help you find the solution faster. One tip is to select a word that includes at least two different vowels, plus some common consonants like S, T, R, or N. The entire archive of past Wordle puzzles used to be available for anyone to enjoy whenever they felt like it. Unfortunately, it has since been taken down , with the website's creator stating it was done at the request of the New York Times . It might feel like Wordle is getting harder, but it actually isn't any more difficult than when it first began . You can turn on Wordle 's Hard Mode if you're after more of a challenge, though. Though usually Wordle will only accept one correct solution per day, occasionally it has rebelled against the norm and deem two different answers acceptable. This is due to changes the New York Times made to Wordle after it acquired the puzzle game . The Times has since added its own updated word list , so this should happen even less frequently than before. To avoid any confusion, it's a good idea to refresh your browser before getting stuck into a new puzzle. Instruments at the ready. Nope. Today's Wordle starts with the letter M. Get your last guesses in now, because it's your final chance to solve today's Wordle before we reveal the solution. Drumroll please! The solution to Wordle #820 is... MUSIC. Don't feel down if you didn't manage to guess it this time. There will be a new Wordle for you to stretch your brain with tomorrow, and we'll be back again to guide you with more helpful hints .

"'Quordle' today: Here are the answers and hints for September 17, 2023","If Quordle is a little too challenging today, you've come to the right place for hints. There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need. Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle , except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds. Yes, though not diabolically so. Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle — the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30 . Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running. “Kwordle.” It should rhyme with “Wordle,” and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like ""curdle.” Yes and no. Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle . In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there’s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you. After your first guess, however, you’ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle . Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you’ve narrowed it down to “-IGHT,” you could guess “MIGHT” “NIGHT” “LIGHT” and “SIGHT” and one of those will probably be the solution — though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle , particularly if you play on “ hard mode .” In Quordle , however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle : In Quordle , you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times. Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven’t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle . In Quordle , however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset. In my experience Quordle can be a slow game, sometimes dragging out longer than it would take to play Wordle four times. But a sort of blunt-force guessing approach can speed things up. The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don’t care about having the fewest possible guesses: Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters. We've had good luck with the three words: “NOTES,” “ACRID,” and “LUMPY.” YouTuber DougMansLand suggests four words: “CANOE,” “SKIRT,” “PLUMB,” and “FUDGY.” Most of the alphabet is now eliminated, and you’ll only have the ability to make one or two wrong guesses if you use this strategy. But in most cases you’ll have all the information you need to guess the remaining words without any wrong guesses. If strategy isn't helping, and you're still stumped, here are some hints: No. Q. S, D, Q, and U. Are you sure you want to know? There’s still time to turn back. OK, you asked for it. The answers are:",entertainment
Tiny French chip startup challenges mighty Amazon to produce formidable quantum chip – inspired by a famous cat,"Quantum computers have shown amazing promise in recent years, with companies from IBM to Google building increasingly powerful machines that are expected to many areas fundamentally, from encryption to medical research. Quibits – quantum bits that occupy a superposition of both 1 and 0 at the same time – are the building blocks of quantum machines. But today’s most powerful quantum computers are hugely inefficient due to a phenomenon called ‘quantum error’. This affects more than 1,000 qubits for every single unaffected ‘logical’ quibit. Now, French startup Alice & Bob are testing a new kind of quibt that’s designed to withstand quantum error – by taking a leaf from the original Shrodinger’s Cat experiment around which the theory of quantum superposition is based. Rather than encoding qubits by using varying energy levels, for instance, Alice & Bob’s strategy involves establishing two diametrically opposed states – such as the state of life or death experienced by the aforementioned cat. Specifically, they’ve used superconducting microwave resonators that fluctuate between two oscillatory states. The researchers say using a quantum computer to break RSA-2048 encryption would need roughly 22 million normal quibits, but just 350,000 of its ‘cat state’ qubits. And, for every single logical qubit, Alice & Bob would need just 40 quibits. Such is the powerful nature of this reserach, Amazon has also started work on its own ‘cat state’ quibits. “When we first learned that Amazon was working on cat qubits, obviously our first reaction as a young startup was to sweat heavily,” Peronnin told the Institute of Electronic Engineering’s (IEEE) Spectrum publication. “But then we slept on it and realized that it might be the best thing to have happened to us. We’re not competing about who’s going to win; it’s cat qubits versus the rest of the possible technologies, so for us, it’s great external validation.” These 'cat states' are highly resistant to bit flip – which means a qubit’s state flips from 1 to 0, or the other way around. They do, however, tend to be more vulnerable to phase flip, in which quibits flip between one of two opposing phases, but the researchers said one kind of error is easier to resolve than two. The company hope to have created a 14-qubit system by the end of 2023, but the startup will need a further six months to calibrate it, so stya tuned for more information soon.",technology

Google Domains has stopped selling new domains,"Earlier this year Google abruptly announced that it would shutter Google Domains after nearly a decade, selling the business to popular site builder Squarespace. Now, as the transition goes on, Google has ceased the sale of new domains. Google Domains somewhat quietly stopped selling domains to new and existing customers on September 7. The change was announced on the Domains website, but only appears when signed out/incognito, and it doesn’t appear the company communicated the change through an email, but some users did notice on that date. The Domains website directs users to instead purchase domains through Squarespace , funnily enough through an affiliate link. The message reads: Squarespace sells domains starting at $12/year, the same cost that Google charged for “average” domains. This change doesn’t force existing users away from using domains.google.com to manage their purchased domains. All existing controls remain in place, customers just can’t add any new domains to their portfolios. A notice at the top of a customer’s library of domains reads that “Squarespace is the registrar of record for your domain” and that “Google will manage your domain during a transition period.” The Squarespace acquisition of Domains was completed on September 7, with sales of new domains ending not long after the completion was announced . Notably, affected customers are able to take advantage of an offer from WordPress that allows for free domain transfers for a limited time, with pricing matched for at least one additional year.",technology
"Special U.N. summit, protests, week of talk turn up heat on fossil fuels and global warming","The heat is about to be turned up on fossil fuels, the United States and President Joe Biden. As a record-smashing and deadly hot summer draws to a close, the United Nations and the city that hosts it are focusing on climate change and the burning of coal, oil and natural gas that causes it. It features a special U.N. summit and a week of protests and talk-heavy events involving leaders from business, health, politics and the arts. Even a royal prince — William — is getting in on the action. The annual Climate Week, which coincides with the U.N. General Assembly, kicks off Sunday with tens of thousands of people expected in the “March to End Fossil Fuels” Manhattan rally, one of hundreds of worldwide protests. This week “is the start of an incredible pressure cooker that we are all part of,” said Jean Su, a march organiser and energy justice director for the Center for Biological Diversity. “It is coming from the top down, from that chief of the United Nations and now it is coming from bottom up in over 400 distributed actions across the world.” Much of the heat is coming from Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who is convening a new Climate Ambition Summit on Wednesday that has a special twist: Only leaders from nations that bring new and meaningful action will be allowed to speak. And the U.N. isn’t saying yet who will get that chance. It won’t be Mr. Biden, who is speaking Tuesday at the U.N., the White House said. Nor will it be the leaders of China, the United Kingdom, Russia or France — all major players in the development and use of fossil fuels — who won’t even be in New York. Mr. Guterres has repeatedly aimed his criticism at fossil fuels, calling them “incompatible with human survival.” He and scientific reports out of the United Nations have emphasised that the only way to curb warming and meet international goals is to “phase out” fossil fuels. Phase-out is a term that world leaders in past climate negotiations and meetings of large economic powers have refused to back, instead opting for watered-down phrases such as “phase down” of unabated coal, allowing fossil use if its emissions are somehow captured and stored. The president of the upcoming international climate negotiations in Dubai is an oil executive from the United Arab Emirates and will be speaking at Wednesday’s summit, though his dual role has upset activists and some scientists. “This really is an unprecedented soft power moment where the U.N. chief is throwing fossil fuels into the limelight and forcing heads of states to respond,” Ms. Su said. “Whether it’s yes or no, he’s at least forcing them to respond as to will you commit to no new fossil fuel development in line with climate science?” But U.N. chiefs have little real power, said Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare, a climate scientist. “They can talk. They can persuade. They can from time-to-time constructively criticise and that’s all the tools that he’s got,"" Mr. Hare said. ""The U.N. secretary-general has moral authority and he’s using that.” Mr. Guterres “can shame leaders who show up with pitiful offers in terms of climate action,” said Power Shift Africa Director Mohamed Adow, a longtime climate diplomacy observer. “We’ve got to a point where we can no longer be able to afford the velvet glove diplomacy.” Mr. Guterres will ask nations to accelerate their efforts to rid themselves of carbon-based energy, with the richest nations that can afford it going first and faster, and providing financial aid to the poorer nations that can’t afford it, said Selwin Hart, Mr. Guterres’ special adviser for climate action. “We know the use of fossil fuels is the main cause of the climate crisis, coal, oil and gas,” Mr. Hart said Friday. “We need to accelerate the global transition away from fossil fuels. But it must be just, fair and equitable.” But the same 20 richest economies who promise to slice carbon emissions “are now issuing new oil and gas licensing at a time when the (International Energy Agency and the science-based Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) has clearly stated that this is incompatible with the 1.5 degree (Celsius, 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) goal of the Paris Agreement,” Mr. Hart said. Yet speeding to net zero emissions of carbon requires rapid and huge reshaping of the energy landscape that “could inflict serious harm on the economy,” American Energy Alliance President Thomas Pyle said last month. Environmental activists calculate that five rich northern countries — the United States, Canada, Australia, Norway and the United Kingdom — that talk about cutting back emissions are responsible for more than half of the planned expansion of oil and gas drilling through 2050. The United States accounts for more than one-third. So activists and protesters at Sunday’s march say they are aiming their frustration — and pressure — at Mr. Biden and America. However, Biden has repeatedly trumpeted last year’s Inflation Reduction Act, which includes $375 billion to fight climate change, mostly on solar panels, energy efficiency, air pollution controls and emission-reducing equipment for coal- and gas-fueled power plants. “They want to be seen as the good guys, but the fact is they have very little to back it up,” said Brandon Wu, policy director at ActionAid USA. He pointed to the new drilling plans and said the United States has failed to deliver on its promised climate-based financial aid to poor countries and has not increased its money pledges like other nations. ""How much carnage does the planet have to suffer for global leaders to act?"" Ms. Su said. ""We want President Biden and other major oil gas producers to phase out fossil fuels.”",world
Sudan’s Burhan holds talks in Uganda as battles rage in Khartoum,"Sudan's de facto leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan held talks on September 16 with Uganda's veteran President Yoweri Museveni on his latest diplomatic foray abroad. The Sudanese general was pictured meeting with Museveni at State House in the Ugandan town of Entebbe on what was described as a one-day working visit. ""They deliberated on bilateral and regional issues,"" said a brief statement from the Ugandan presidency. Sudan has been at war since April when fighting erupted between the regular army led by Mr. Burhan and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces commanded by his deputy-turned-rival Mohamed Hamdan Daglo. Clashes around Khartoum's military headquarters — where Mr. Burhan had been holed up until last month — had seen a brief two-week respite before flaring again, with the RSF showering it with artillery fire, residents said Saturday. Eyewitnesses on the ground told AFP they heard clashes in central Khartoum, with one resident saying the RSF ""is firing heavy artillery"" at army headquarters. From his new base in the Red Sea coastal city of Port Sudan, Mr. Burhan has since late August made six trips abroad in what analysts say is a diplomatic push to burnish his credentials in the event of negotiations to end the conflict. His first visit was to Egypt, followed by South Sudan, Qatar, Eritrea, Turkey and now Uganda. At least 7,500 people have been killed since the conflict broke out on April 15, according to a conservative estimate from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project. The war has uprooted more than five million people, including one million who fled across borders, according to United Nations figures. Neither side has been able to gain the upper hand in the conflict, with the army controlling the skies and Daglo's fighters embedding themselves in residential areas. Witnesses have noted an increase in the intensity of air strikes, and consequently the civilian death toll, as the army seeks to regain control of parts of the capital. Mr. Burhan has been Sudan's de facto leader since the ouster of longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir in 2019, when he was appointed head of the Sovereign Council of military and civilian figures tasked with steering the transition to a fully-fledged democracy.",world
Pakistan court objects to reopen case of Bhagat Singh’s sentencing,"A Pakistani court on September 16 raised an objection on a plea to reopen the case of Independence war hero Bhagat Singh's sentencing in 1931 and to set it aside by exercising the principles of review and honour him with posthumous state awards. Singh was hanged by the British rulers on March 23, 1931, along with his comrades Rajguru and Sukhdev after being tried under charges of hatching a conspiracy against the British regime. Singh was initially jailed for life but was later sentenced to death in another “fabricated case”. On Saturday, the Lahore High Court (LHC) raised an objection to reopening the decade-old case and constitution of a larger bench to listen to the petition that pleads to set aside the sentence of Singh by exercising principles of review and order the government to honour him with posthumous state awards. ""The Lahore High Court on Saturday raised an objection to reopen the Bhagat Singh case and constitution of a larger bench for its early hearing. The court objected that the petition is not maintainable for the constitution of a larger bench,"" Advocate Imtiaz Rashid Qureshi, chairman of the Bhagat Singh Memorial Foundation and one of the petitioners, told PTI. Mr. Qureshi said that the petition of a panel of senior lawyers of which he is part has been pending in the LHC for a decade. ""Justice Shujaat Ali Khan in 2013 had referred the matter to the chief justice for the constitution of a larger bench, since then it has been pending,"" he said. The petition says that Bhagat Singh fought for the independence of the sub-continent. The petition further says that Singh is respected in the subcontinent not only by the Sikhs, and Hindus but also Muslims. Founder of Pakistan Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah twice had paid him tribute during his speech in the Central Assembly. ""It is a matter of national importance and should be fixed before a full bench,"" Mr. Qureshi pleaded. He said Singh's name was not mentioned in the First Information Report of the murder of British police officer John P. Saunders for which he was sentenced to death. About a decade ago, the Lahore police had searched through the records of the Anarkali police station on the court's order and managed to find the FIR of the murder of Saunders. Written in Urdu, the FIR was registered with the Anarkali police station on December 17, 1928, at 4.30 p.m. against two 'unknown gunmen'. The case was registered under sections 302, 120 and 109 of the Indian Penal Code. Mr. Qureshi said that the special judges of the tribunal handling Bhagat Singh’s case sentenced him to death without hearing 450 witnesses in the case. Singh’s lawyers were not given the opportunity to cross-question them, he said. ""We will establish Bhagat Singh's innocence in the Saunders case,"" he said.",world
British actor-comedian Russell Brand denies media allegations of sex assaults,"British comedian and actor Russell Brand has denied any criminal wrongdoing as the Sunday Times newspaper reported four women had accused him of sexual assaults, including rape, during a seven-year period when he was at the height of his fame. Brand, 48, the former husband of U.S. singer Katy Perry, issued a denial to unspecified ""very serious criminal allegations"" hours before they were published online by the newspaper on Saturday. The Sunday Times did not say if any of the women had made complaints to the police. Reuters was unable to reach Brand's representatives for further response after the paper's report was published. The Times , which reported the alleged incidents had taken place between 2006 and 2013, said one woman had made an allegation of rape, while another said Brand assaulted her when she was 16 and still at school. Two of the accusers reported the incidents occurred in Los Angeles, the paper said. Channel 4 TV's documentary show Dispatches, which was due to air further details of the allegations later on Saturday, also broadcast a number of clips of the women on X, formerly known as Twitter, describing the alleged incidents. In a video message posted on social media, Brand said the accusations contained ""a litany of extremely egregious and aggressive attacks as well as some pretty stupid stuff"". ""But amidst this litany of astonishing rather baroque attacks, are some very serious allegations that I absolutely refute,"" he said. ""These allegations pertain to the time when I was working in the mainstream, when I was in the newspapers all the time, when I was in the movies. And as I've written about extensively in my books, I was very, very promiscuous,"" Brand said. ""Now, during that time of promiscuity, the relationships I had were absolutely always consensual."" The Sunday Times said its report was the result of a joint investigation with Dispatches that began in 2019. Brand was once one of Britain's most-high profile comedians, known for his flamboyant style and appearance, a regular on television and radio, including working for the BBC , during the 2000s while he also starred in a number of films such as Get Him to the Greek . He married Perry in a lavish wedding in India in 2010, but filed for divorce just 14 months later. He now mainly focuses on online projects and has a large following for his regular podcasts and shows on social media. ""I don't mind them using my books and my stand-up to talk about my promiscuous consensual conduct in the past,"" he said in his video message. ""What I seriously refute are these very, very serious criminal allegations.""",world
The frontrunner | Mohamed Muizzu,"It was no secret that Mohamed Muizzu entered the Maldives’s presidential race only because former President Abdulla Yameen could not. In fact, local media often called him the opposition People’s National Congress- Progressive Party of Maldives combine’s ‘plan C’, after the Supreme Court barred Mr. Yameen from contesting, and party members ruled out Dr. Mohamed Waheed, another former President. Nonetheless, observers in the Maldives knew that ‘Dr. Muizzu’ — he holds a PhD in civil engineering from the University of Leeds, U.K. — was the opposition’s most credible challenger to President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih. He proved their assessment right, securing the highest share — of 46.06% — of the ballot in the September 9 elections, while Mr. Solih secured 39.05%. Since neither candidate got over 50% necessary for victory, the top two will face a run-off on September 30. It was not an easy campaign for Mr. Muizzu. After the top court made clear Mr. Yameen could not run, the jailed leader, convicted on corruption and money laundering charges, asked his party to boycott the polls. However, with the party membership refusing, the opposition bloc had to swiftly find a candidate agreeable within the coalition, and formidable as an electoral rival to the incumbent. After considerable internal debate, Mr. Muizzu was named. He had barely a month to campaign and convince the 5.2 lakh-strong country’s electorate of 2.8 lakh voters. But, he was no new face in Maldives politics. In 2021, Mr. Muizzu became the Mayor of capital Male, after beating the ruling Maldivian Democratic Party’s (MDP) candidate with a huge margin. Prior to that, he served as the Minister of Housing twice, in the Cabinets of former Presidents Mr. Waheed and Mr. Yameen. While in the latter’s government, he oversaw the construction of the $200-million China-Maldives friendship bridge, linking the capital to the neighbouring Hulhumale island, where the country’s main airport is located. Last month, while marking the fifth anniversary of the bridge’s opening, Mr. Muizzu praised the “visionary leadership” of Mr. Yameen and Chinese President Xi Jinping. His experience in dealing with housing challenges in the country, as a Minister earlier and Mayor now, gives him the insight and vocabulary to address mounting concerns over housing that many Maldivians are preoccupied with. His manifesto outlined a plan to allocate 65,000 flats in and around the capital, better electricity connectivity and water network, and enhanced infrastructure in the atolls located to the north and south of the capital. Although he was left with little time ahead of the polls, it was not as if Mr. Muizzu had to craft a campaign from scratch. The Opposition had already built considerable momentum, chiefly from the “India Out” drive spearheaded by Mr. Yameen. A strong anti-incumbency sentiment against the Solih administration, amid allegations of corruption and repression, saw some voters grow sympathetic to the Opposition’s critique of President Solih’s “India first” policy, although they were well-aware of the obvious China tilt of Mr. Yameen’s administration from 2013 to 2018. Seen through a geopolitical prism, the contest in the Maldives is an India-China one. Outside of it, the current dynamics reflect the churn that continues after the Indian Ocean Archipelago transitioned to democracy in 2008. The outcome of the first round could be read as a “revolt against the government”, according to U.K.-based Maldivian academic Ahmed Shaheed. Further, former President Mohamed Nasheed’s decision to break away from the ruling MDP also impacted Mr. Solih’s chances. “With Mr. Nasheed’s split, the motherboard of the MDP was gone,” observed Mr. Shaheed, a former Foreign Minister of the Maldives. With just a fortnight left for the second round of the presidential race, both Mr. Solih and Mr. Muizzu are negotiating with the other contestants, seeking their support. Ahead of the first round of the polls, every opposition election poster and hoarding in capital Male, in the party’s hot pink colour, screamed that Mr. Yameen is still boss. They foregrounded Mr. Yameen’s image, placing photographs of Mr. Muizzu and his running mate behind his. Now considered the frontrunner, Mr. Muizzu, 45, has vowed to double the salaries of the police and army, and defer their rent payments, among other fresh promises. In two weeks from now, it will be clear if they were enough to tip the electoral scales the second time.",world
'Off-kilter' MSU routed in 1st game without Tucker,"In its first game since head coach Mel Tucker was suspended, Michigan State suffered a devastating 41-7 loss at home to Washington on Saturday. Interim head coach Harlon Barnett took over on Sunday after Tucker was suspended amid an ongoing investigation into claims that he sexually harassed sexual assault awareness speaker Brenda Tracy. Barnett said the suspension was abrupt and the week was different than what anyone in the program has had to deal with but that he believes the team did everything right in moving forward to focus on the game against the Huskies. ""There were a lot of different things that came about, but it's going to all settle down this week,"" Barnett told reporters after the contest. ""I got some things in my mind I want to do as far as me coaching and try to normalize us again. Whereas this past week, we were off-kilter a little bit."" The Spartans' defense gave up 713 yards of offense to Washington, a record for any Michigan State team. Barnett said he didn't realize it was a record. But he said he is going to remember it and everything that took place in the game without excuses for what distractions might or might not have been out there this week for his team. He said he recognized the difficulty of the week but that he believed his team prepared as best it could for a strong opponent. He explained he didn't want to focus much on the past or what had happened with Tucker but rather on how he can galvanize the team moving forward and get back a sense of normalcy for his players. ""We are a week away from what happened,"" Barnett said. ""So, those guys, that's out of their system; we played the game, played a really great team. And so, I think they're ready to go and understand that all of our goals are still in front of us, so that's a good thing."" Senior offensive lineman J.D. Duplain said the Spartans players ""bought in"" to Barnett -- who has been with the Michigan State program a total of 15 seasons throughout his career -- and that there was no hesitation that they would trust him the rest of the way. ""Our team bought in to Coach Barnett; we trust him fully,"" Duplain said. ""We had good unity going into this weekend, guys were bought in. I think everyone was mission focused. We just made too many mistakes. And we're going to go back and watch film, we're going to learn from it, because the best teams, they learn from games like this."" Senior wide receiver Tre Mosley echoed Duplain, saying the players did what they could to limit distractions without Tucker. ""The first day when it came out, it was a shock to everyone. But after that, we did a great job moving on because we had an opponent to get ready for,"" Mosley said. ""We couldn't live in the past or start to cry, because Washington didn't care what was going on with us in our program. So, we had to go out there and prepare for this game."" Despite the loss, Duplain and Mosley said the team is eager to get back to work and try to fix the issues with Maryland next on its schedule. With or without Tucker, Michigan State (2-1) is moving forward. And despite being thrust into the role, Barnett said he is ready to take the coaching duties head on now that he has more time to prepare the team. ""There are ups and downs, there are valleys you hit as well as the mountaintops,"" Barnett said. ""This is a valley moment. The good thing about it is you can always come back from a valley moment if you truly believe and trust and then start to work on the things that need to be worked on. ""So, valley moment right now, but we'll get back up to the mountain.""",sports
Sanders honored as statue unveiled at Ford Field,"DETROIT -- An 8-foot bronze statue of one of the greatest players in NFL history in action now graces the corner of Montcalm and Brush Streets in the heart of downtown Detroit. On the eve of their home opener against the Seattle Seahawks, the Detroit Lions immortalized Hall of Fame running back Barry Sanders with a statue outside of Ford Field on Saturday in a non-public event. Sanders is the first player in franchise history to receive the honor, and the humble star was grateful for the organization's gesture. ""You heard the saying that you give a person their flowers while they're around,"" Sanders said during the ceremony. ""I don't plan on going anywhere any time soon, I'm just saying that saying ... but if this statue could be used with that analogy, then I would have to say this is one heck of a bouquet for me, so thanks a lot. I appreciate it."" The statue was produced by artists Omri Amrany and Lou Cella of Fine Art Studio Rotblatt Amrany. Their Illinois-based company also created the Michael Jordan statue located inside Chicago's United Center as well as the Magic Johnson statue outside of Los Angeles' Crypto.com Arena, among many other bronze sculptures of sports legends. Sanders admired the details of his statue, in which he is depicted performing one of his signature juke moves on a defender. ""Little things like the cut-off gloves that I wore and obviously the very alert eyes,"" Sanders said. ""I haven't had a chance to really soak it in, but those were some of the things I noticed and obviously sort of the pose is like I'm in action."" Among those in attendance for the ceremony were Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, former Lions coach Wayne Fontes, hip-hop legend Flavor Flav, Hall of Fame wide receiver Calvin Johnson, Lions owner Sheila Hamp and general manager Brad Holmes, as well as family, friends, former teammates and coaches. A group of season-ticket holders from Sanders' playing days was also present for the ceremony. A tribute video was projected onto a large screen, featuring Sanders' personal journey and highlights as well as congratulatory messages from sports figures such as Jerry Rice, Peyton Manning, Emmitt Smith and Joe Dumars. ""I've always been a big fan of Barry Sanders since I was young, and he paved the way for a whole bunch of running backs right now out here in the game,"" Flavor Flav told ESPN. ""Barry is the man. That's why I'm here."" One of the most electrifying players in league history, Sanders is fourth on the NFL's all-time rushing list with 15,269 yards in just 10 seasons. Now 55, he retired abruptly ahead of the 1999 season at age 31. Sanders recently announced that he will release a new documentary in November in which he will discuss the ""great mystery"" of why he walked away from football so soon. In 2021, Sanders was honored with a 9-foot statue at his alma mater, Oklahoma State University, outside of Boone Pickens Stadium, but he said he doesn't consider his statue in Detroit as being late. ""I think it's perfect timing,"" Sanders said. ""Again, I'm not going to say I was sort of lobbying for it. If you look at the last 24 years that I've been out, then I think this is the perfect time to do it in my mind."" Lions rookie Jahmyr Gibbs, the No. 12 overall pick in this year's draft, became the franchise's highest-drafted running back since Sanders was selected third overall in 1989 after winning the Heisman Trophy at OSU. Gibbs said he was ""starstruck"" after meeting Sanders for the first time this offseason. As Gibbs prepares for his second NFL game, he said he was excited to see his idol honored while he's a part of the team. ""That's amazing for anybody to get a statue,"" Gibbs told ESPN. ""It shows that he had a big impact on Detroit, and it shows how thankful the city is for him. I'm happy. Hopefully I can get one of them one day."" Like Gibbs, Lions third-year receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown was excited to see greatness up close while being part of the current roster. The Lions are looking for their first 2-0 start since 2017. ""I wasn't able to watch Barry play because obviously, he's a little older than me and I was too young, but I remember being a kid,"" St. Brown said. ""I played running back my whole life, until I got to high school, and my dad would always show me highlights of Barry. That was the guy. He said he was the 'coldest dude out.' So, when I was a kid, I was Barry all the way. Barry and Reggie Bush. ""Those were my guys, and just watching his highlights, I would be like, 'This dude is crazy.' Just being here now, with him getting a statue as one of the best to ever do it, in the entire NFL history, is cool. Just to be on this team to see it is dope.""",sports
The SEC powers don't look all too powerful in a surprisingly chaotic Week 3,"There are just three weeks of college football in the books, so it's entirely too early to pen a eulogy for the SEC, but Saturday offered some motivation for commissioner Greg Sankey to at least pull his dark suit out of the closet and make sure it still fits. In Athens, the two-time defending champion Georgia Bulldogs went to the half trailing unranked South Carolina 14-3. Georgia rebounded, but through three games, this hardly seems like the same dominant force we've come to expect. In soggy Tampa, Florida, mighty Alabama, fresh off a shocking loss to Texas, went to the half tied at 3 with lowly USF. The Tide prevailed, but the QB room is in chaos, and coach Nick Saban doesn't seem to have an answer. In a rollicking Gainesville, upstart Tennessee saw its long-shot playoff status evaporate at the mercy of a suddenly magical Graham Mertz. Tennessee and Florida both now have a loss, as do LSU and Texas A&M. None of this was supposed to happen. Saturday was set to be a snooze fest, a week without a single ranked-vs.-ranked matchup and a host of lopsided point spreads. Instead, the SEC's power players nearly sleepwalked into oblivion. Georgia came to life in the second half against the Gamecocks, with walk-on Cash Jones putting the game on ice with a 13-yard touchdown run midway through the fourth quarter. Perhaps in the absence of Stetson Bennett, the Bulldogs just needed another underdog story to jump-start their season. Still, three weeks into the season, Carson Beck has just three touchdown throws -- none of them to Brock Bowers. It's entirely possible this is just a new offense working through some trial-and-error adjustments, and it certainly wouldn't be out of character for the Bulldogs to bide their time and step on the gas only when absolutely needed. The schedule doesn't indicate those moments will come frequently, and yet, it'd be more reassuring if Georgia would deliver at least one true act of aggression, dominating an opponent and stealing its lunch money. For Alabama, the whispers about the end of a dynasty have grown to an audible murmur. Last week's loss to Texas was a cause for concern, of course, but barely cracking 100 passing yards against USF is something far more unsettling. They say a team that has two quarterbacks actually has none, which makes Alabama's situation at least 50% worse than that. Saban benched Jalen Milroe with a clear eye toward determining whether Alabama had an effective Plan B or C on the shelf. Instead, he opened the cupboard to find some expired tuna and a half-empty box of Triscuits. For Tennessee, Joe Milton's arm was supposed to be the magic elixir that allowed the Vols' offense to keep piling up points in 2023, but behind a line that couldn't block and with a receiving corps that couldn't get open downfield, it was like casting Taylor Swift in a mime act. (Actually, we'd watch that.) When the dust settles, Georgia will still be atop the AP poll, and Alabama, LSU and others still have genuine playoff hopes, even if the road ahead is winding. Perhaps this is all prologue to the real drama that awaits. But the vibes of Week 3 were all off, like Dreamland dousing their ribs in vinegar sauce. It's just not how things are done here. And if this is indeed a new era of college football, when the power is all out west and the SEC is simply holding on for dear life -- well, it's probably time to start building that bunker and stocking up on canned goods. We don't want to know what awaits in that future. FSU escapes BC It was a noon kickoff, which in late September in Boston is the perfect setting for a James Taylor ballad and a BC upset. It was the Eagles' annual Red Bandana game, a chance to honor Boston College graduate Welles Crowther, who saved more than a dozen lives by sacrificing his own on 9/11. It was supposed to be a tune-up for No. 3 Florida State, a game against battered BC to pad the stats before a potentially season-defining trip to Clemson in Week 4. It was a trap so diabolical, it could've been the plot of a ""Saw"" sequel. And for all the obvious dangers, Florida State managed to trip over its own shoelaces and fall face-first into quicksand. Yes, FSU ultimately prevailed 31-29 to keep its national title hopes alive, but along the way, the two teams traded jabs -- or, more often, bullets to their own feet, and the Seminoles secured the win only after Boston College delivered one final self-own. But let's not skip too far ahead. The game began in sleepy Chestnut Hill with BC jumping out to a 10-3 lead, stunning a groggy FSU. It felt entirely similar to the biggest test FSU's last national title team faced back in 2013, when a trip to BC began with a quick 17-3 deficit. In that game, Jameis Winston rallied the Seminoles, who dominated the second half en route to a 48-34 win. On Saturday, Jordan Travis attempted to do the same, and by the time Eagles fans found their seats after halftime, the Noles were up 31-10. Crisis averted. Bring on the Tigers. Except, BC had other ideas. An Eagles touchdown was followed by a fumble return for a score and a dynamic 95-yard TD drive, and suddenly BC was within two with 4:37 to play. If Florida State seemed intent on giving the game away, however, BC was all too happy to take the gift, rewrap it, and hand it right back. Boston College finished the game with 18 penalties. The Eagles were flagged for offsides, false starts, personal fouls, cutting those ""do not remove"" tags off their mattresses and just about every other infraction an official could dream up. But it was the 18th penalty that proved the final dagger. Lawrance Toafili was pushed out of bounds for a 4-yard gain on third-and-7 with just under a minute to play. BC had a chance to get the ball back and win the game. But a face mask flag gave FSU 15 yards and a first down, sealing the game -- a mistake so costly and yet so predictable that BC coach Jeff Hafley proceeded to walk into Boston Harbor, never to be seen again. (Probably.) For Florida State, it was a classic trap-game performance, one replete with miscues, mental mistakes and a terror-inducing injury to Travis, who appeared to hurt his left arm before the half -- though he later returned and finished 212 passing yards and two touchdowns. For Boston College, it was a golden opportunity that slipped through its fingers like a buttered lobster tail. In other words, it was misery for both sides. This, of course, is the beauty of those sleepy Saturday mornings in late September. On paper, they're all sweet dreams and flying machines, but by mid-afternoon, contenders and afterthoughts alike can be left in pieces. Real or not? In a week with no ranked-vs.-ranked matchups, it's worth checking in with a few teams sitting pretty at 3-0 that haven't truly been tested yet. Are they playoff contenders or paper tigers? Let's find out. Penn State The Nittany Lions got off to a slow start against Illinois but were never in any real trouble and ultimately won 30-13. Penn State has been favored by at least 14 in every game and covered each spread. Drew Allar has been good if not representing a seismic shift from the Sean Clifford era. The defense has allowed just 35 points so far this season. Playoff contender? Probably. Penn State has a ton of talent, but we'll know a lot more after next week's showdown with Iowa in which the first team to two might win. Ohio State The Buckeyes' offense was lackluster in each of its first two games -- both easy though unremarkable wins -- and it looked to be trending in the same direction early against Western Kentucky on Saturday. But after WKU pulled to within four midway through the second quarter, Ohio State seemed to get things figured out. Kyle McCord threw for 318 yards and three touchdowns, Marvin Harrison Jr. had a breakout performance with 126 yards and a score, and the Buckeyes won 63-10. Playoff contender? Absolutely. Ohio State simply didn't want to put anything on tape that suspended Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh could dissect during his down time. Of course, Harbaugh wasn't watching Ohio State film anyway. He was busy finishing his fan fiction sequel to ""Fred Claus."" Oklahoma The Sooners lost four of their last five in 2022, but those memories have been wiped amid a hot start to 2023. Oklahoma thrashed Tulsa 66-17 on Saturday behind five touchdown passes from Dillon Gabriel. Through three games, Oklahoma has outscored its opposition 167-28. Playoff contender? Not yet. Go back to the start of 2022, and things didn't look much different than they do now. Oklahoma opened last season 3-0 with blowout wins vs. UTEP, Kent State and Nebraska, too. The good news for the Sooners this time around is they won't go into Week 4 with the Nebraska curse attached to them. Notre Dame After a slow start, the Irish cruised to a 41-17 win over Central Michigan on Saturday. Sam Hartman threw for 330 yards and three touchdowns, and in his four-game Irish career, he's now accounted for 15 touchdowns and no picks. Playoff contender? Check back next month. Notre Dame is 4-0 with each win coming by at least 21 points, but the real test comes next week with a home date against Ohio State. That's followed by games against 3-0 Duke, 3-0 Louisville and 3-0 USC. If the Irish can come out of that gauntlet looking strong, they'll certainly have a resume worth considering. Washington The Huskies are 3-0 after demolishing Michigan State on Saturday, and their average margin of victory is about 603. (We rounded up.) Michael Penix Jr. has thrown for 400 yards in all three games this season. Supposedly Washington also has running backs, but no one's bothered to look for them, so who knows? Playoff contender? An outside shot. Oh, Washington has a star QB, puts up a ton of points, beats bad teams in blowouts and is highly ranked? Welcome to the Pac-12 (for the next five months anyway). The depth of the league makes the likelihood that any one team survives the season largely unscathed unlikely. Michigan Life without Harbaugh has gone more or less as expected. The Wolverines beat Bowling Green Falcons 31-6 on Saturday, and they have outscored their opposition 96-16 so far. Like a nice pair of khakis, it's been entirely effective and without a semblance of excitement. Playoff contender? Sure, but they've got Rutgers on deck, and that's where the real work begins. Rutgers The Scarlet Knights are 3-0 and have allowed just 30 points so far. Rutgers beat the Virginia Tech Hokies 35-16 on Saturday despite passing for just 46 yards. Playoff contender? Heck, yeah. Let's get weird. Down goes K-State If FSU managed to elude disaster, Kansas State wasn't so lucky. Brady Cook threw for 356 yards and accounted for three touchdowns, and Harrison Mevis booted a 61-yard field goal as time expired to give Missouri a 30-27 win over the 15th-ranked Wildcats. Missouri's win came in spite of a woeful 3-of-13 performance on third down, a missed 53-yard kick by Mevis in the first half, and a delay of game flag before the final kick when Eli Drinkwitz was too slow getting his field goal unit onto the field. Still, after the kick skirted just over the crossbar, Missouri fans rushed the field -- marking the best rushing performance the Tigers have had since 2019. Ideal outcome for Hawkeyes Let's recap Iowa's 41-10 win over Western Michigan: Iowa's defense recorded a safety. Iowa completed just 50% of its passes. Iowa had multiple TD throws and runs in the same game for the first time since 2021. Offensive coordinator Brian Ferentz had a sideline meltdown worthy of fine art. Thanks to its defense, Iowa had touchdown drives of 25, 53, 17 and 33 yards. Aided by a final TD with 30 seconds to play, the Hawkeyes scored enough to raise their season average to a whopping 28.3 points per game, putting Ferentz safely into the ""Do not fire"" tier of assistant coaches. And that, friends, is Iowa B-I-N-G-O. Oh, and there's only one proper way to celebrate hitting Iowa B-I-N-G-O. Cyclones get robbed For teams from the state of Iowa, points are like a lunar eclipse. They happen a few times a year, but they're still rare enough to bring the whole family out into the backyard to gawk. So it seemed entirely unfair that, when Iowa State had appeared to put three points on the board midway through the fourth quarter, some visually-challenged officials flubbed the call. What looked like a clearly successful field goal was ruled a miss, and Iowa State ended up losing to Ohio 10-7. It was the Cyclones' 10th loss in their past 11 games vs. FBS opponents, and they've averaged 11.2 points per game in those 10 losses. Under-the-radar play of the week We celebrate all touchdowns by men over 300 pounds here, and Oregon State delivered a beauty on Saturday. Beavers QB DJ Uiagalelei took the snap, rolled to his right, then tossed back across the field to 305-pound offensive lineman Joshua Gray, who then rumbled 10 yards into the end zone. Under-the-radar game of the week The Backyard Brawl is among the great rivalries in college football, but with West Virginia and Pitt both carrying a loss, there was limited enthusiasm for this year's installment. But overlooking a rivalry game between one fan base that thinks French fries are a salad and another that thinks grain alcohol is a condiment would be a mistake. What the Panthers and Mountaineers played Saturday was less a football game than a staring contest. The two teams combined to complete just six passes in the first half. Neither offense had anything resembling an effective game plan. The Benny's Pizza Challenge has a better completion percentage than Pitt QB Phil Jurkovec at this point. In other words, it was a thing of beauty. Neither team threw for 100 yards. Neither team tallied 250 total yards. Both teams looked as if they'd been transported onto the field from 1936 in some sort of strange ""Quantum Leap"" scenario. The final score -- West Virginia 17, Pitt 6 -- felt entirely too normal for a game that was so perfectly unpleasant, but that's what makes the Backyard Brawl so great. To simply look at the box score is to only partially understand how brutal it is. Like the answering machine scene in ""Swingers,"" you really have to watch it to fully appreciate just how bad it can get.",sports
Noche UFC Grasso vs. Shevchenko 2: Live results and analysis,"Alexa Grasso defends her UFC women's flyweight title against former longtime champ Valentina Shevchenko in the main event of Noche UFC on Saturday in Las Vegas.The fights at T-Mobile Arena are on ESPN+, with the 10 p.m. ET main card preceded by prelims at 7 p.m. The Noche UFC event is the promotion's celebration of Mexican Independence Day. Grasso (16-3) has won five fights in a row, most recently a fourth-round submission of Shevchenko in March that earned the Mexican her title. Grasso is No. 3 in the ESPN women's pound-for-pound rankings. Shevchenko (23-4) -- ranked No. 2 in ESPN's pound-4-pound rankings -- had won nine straight prior to the loss to Grasso, including seven defenses of the 125-pound title she won in 2018.

"Week 3's best trolls: No cats allowed, but we need more cowbell","College football internet generally has no chill. Mix in the start of the conference schedule for some leagues -- and some grudges -- and the trolling gets cranked up. The LSU Tigers went on the road Saturday and absolutely crushed the Mississippi State Bulldogs. The Duke Blue Devils continued their hot start, and the Portland State Vikings went to the archives for a shot at the North Texas Mean Green, whom they were not playing. Here are some of the best trolls from Week 3: Ohio State Buckeyes 63, Western Kentucky Hilltoppers 10 The Buckeyes weren't looking ahead to next week's meeting with the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. OSU demolished WKU behind three touchdown passes from Kyle McCord and two rushing scores from TreVeyon Henderson. You might say the Buckeyes had no trouble with the hilly elevation. LSU 41, Mississippi State 14 The Tigers had no trouble with Stark Vegas and the clanging cowbells of the Bulldogs fans. LSU has now won 11 of its past 12 trips to Mississippi State, and it piled up 530 yards of offense in this game. LSU's social media team channeled a classic ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch to take its shot at MSU. Duke 38, Northwestern 14 For just the second time in 60 years, Duke has won three straight games by 20 or more points. On Saturday, QB Riley Leonard had 316 total yards and two rushing touchdowns. It was his fifth career game with multiple rushing TDs. And for the third consecutive game, Duke has beaten a team with a big cat mascot (Clemson Tigers, Lafayette Leopards, Northwestern Wildcats). Maybe the Blue Devils are just dog people. Portland State 91, North American Stallions 0 You would never know Portland State was 0-2 going into Saturday and gave up 81 points in its season opener against the Oregon Ducks. The Vikings blasted the Stallions, an NAIA team. Somewhere in there, a North Texas account decided to chime in. The internet -- and the Big Sky Conference's social team -- doesn't forget. It went to the archives to remind North Texas fans of the 2015 game its team lost to Portland State.",sports
Saban mum on QB1 after Bama struggles vs. USF,"Alabama's quarterback competition took another sour turn during a 17-3 win on the road against South Florida on Saturday. Jalen Milroe, the Crimson Tide's starter through the first two games of the season, was benched after throwing two interceptions in a home loss to Texas last week, and he didn't take a snap in Tampa. Tyler Buchner, who transferred from Notre Dame following spring practice, got the start versus the Bulls and struggled, completing just 5 of 14 pass attempts for 34 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions before he was pulled. Redshirt freshman Ty Simpson came on in relief of Buchner and played the rest of the contest, going 5-of-9 for 73 yards. Simpson scored on a 1-yard run, but he was sacked five times. After the game, Alabama coach Nick Saban tried to preempt questions about the position. ""I know you're going to ask about the quarterbacks,"" he told reporters. ""We're going to evaluate the quarterbacks that played today and evaluate Jalen Milroe in terms of how he played and decide this week who gives us the best opportunity to be successful as an offensive team. And that's the way we'll go."" Pressed for more details about what went into the decision to play Buchner and Simpson, Saban said it was an ""internal"" decision. ""Everybody has the opportunity to respond in the right way when things don't go like you want them to,"" Saban added. ""And we play the guys that practice the best all week long."" Saban told ESPN during the game that Simpson, a former four-star prospect, had the best week of practice. ""I thought he did OK,"" Saban said of Simpson's performance against USF. ""Made a couple really good throws. Missed a couple big-play throws. ... I thought he played well, managed the game well."" Saban said it wasn't Simpson's fault he was under so much pressure from the defense. The coach was asked about the play of the offensive line and responded with a question of his own: ""How many sacks did they have today?"" The answer: five. ""Based on that, I wouldn't evaluate it very well,"" Saban said. ""Some of them were mental errors. We knew they were going to pressure a lot. They got a really good pressure package. We messed up the protections several times. We got beat a couple times. ""So we need to get that fixed, because that's been an area that has been a consistent problem for us all year -- last week with the sacks, this week with the sacks. And those are drive killers, and we got to eliminate that."" Despite the offensive struggles, Saban tried to strike an optimistic tone. He said he was proud of the way the team competed during a hard-fought away game that featured an hourlong lightning delay. He noted there was adversity, including starting guard Tyler Booker being sidelined by back spasms, but that he liked the way his players ""kept answering the bell."" ""We didn't execute great, so I don't feel good about that,"" Saban said. ""But the way we competed in the game, I thought, was outstanding."" Alabama (2-1) will open SEC play at home against Ole Miss next Saturday.",sports
Umpire exits Jays game after being hit by foul tips,"TORONTO -- Plate umpire Jordan Baker left Saturday's Boston Red Sox-Toronto Blue Jays game after eight innings because of the impact of being struck by multiple foul tips and entered Major League Baseball's concussion protocol. The 41-year-old Baker, a member of MLB's staff since 2014, will miss Sunday's series finale at a minimum, according to the commissioner's office. Baker needed attention from Toronto's athletic trainer after he was hit on the left shoulder during Justin Turner's at-bat in the fourth. Baker left the field between the top and bottom of the inning to receive further treatment. ""You hate seeing an umpire get hurt like that,"" Blue Jays manager John Schneider said. ""Jordan took a beating today."" The game was delayed after eight innings while second-base umpire Brennan Miller changed into his gear to work the plate. The game continued with three umpires.",sports
Ohtani focus on elbow procedure as year ends,"ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Shohei Ohtani underwent an MRI on Friday afternoon that showed lingering irritation in his right oblique, prompting him to shut down his season as a hitter and shift his focus to treating the torn ulnar collateral ligament that previously ended his season as a pitcher, Los Angeles Angels general manager Perry Minasian said Saturday. ""I don't have details on the procedure,"" Minasian said, ""but obviously he wants to get that as quick as he can and start getting ready for '24."" Ohtani, who'll be a free agent at season's end, plans on continuing to hit and pitch down the road, and his agent, Nez Balelo of CAA, previously said he will be ready to at least hit ""when the bell rings"" at the start of the 2024 season. Ohtani could use platelet-rich plasma and stem-cell therapy to treat the tear in his right UCL, but it seems more likely that he'll go the surgical route, either with Tommy John surgery or an internal bracing procedure or some combination of both. Any invasive procedure would probably rule out Ohtani as a pitcher in 2024. ""Shohei -- he's one of a kind,"" Minasian said. ""Great player, great person. I think anybody that knows him, has a chance to talk to him, be around him -- he's a team guy. He's a pretty special guy, he's a pretty special player, and it's been a pleasure to get to know him these last three years and hopefully he's here for a long time."" Ohtani, 29, suffered an oblique strain during a rare session of outdoor batting practice on Sept. 4 and proceeded to miss the next 11 games. He left Angel Stadium at around 4 p.m. PT on Friday to undergo an MRI, Minasian said, then received his results early in the Angels' ensuing game against the Detroit Tigers. Media members entered the home clubhouse at Angel Stadium later that night to find that Ohtani's locker had been mostly cleared out, creating a stir on social media that Minasian tried his best to diffuse during his news conference on Saturday. ""I think in his mind he thought there was a possibility for a procedure today, and that's why he packed,"" Minasian said. ""Nothing malicious. There's no story here. He's so focused on, 'Season's over, I gotta get ready for '24,' and that was what his mindset was. He's planning on being here the last homestand. He's going to be here today, tomorrow."" Ohtani put together another spectacular season and appears to be a lock to win the American League's Most Valuable Player Award for the second time in three years. He slashed .304/.412/.654 while leading the AL in home runs (44), walks (91) and total bases (325) as a hitter and went 10-5 with a 3.14 ERA in 132 innings as a pitcher, striking out 167 batters and issuing 55 walks. Despite pitching and hitting for only about five out of six months, Ohtani's 9.0 FanGraphs wins above replacement easily leads the majors. The Angels, however, are barreling toward their eighth consecutive losing season, which would set a franchise record. Despite also employing Mike Trout and Anthony Rendon, both of whom have been beset by injuries these past three years, the Angels haven't even been relevant in the stretch run of the regular season in their six years with Ohtani. Asked about the chances of re-signing him as a free agent, Minasian said: ""That would be a question for him. But I think he really enjoys his time here. Obviously, he's had three of the greatest -- if not the greatest -- years any player has ever had. I think he enjoys his teammates and the area and the fan base and the organization. There's a lot of trust and a lot of communication. I hope he's here for a long time."" The Angels, under then-GM Billy Eppler and former manager Mike Scioscia, recruited Ohtani out of Japan in December 2017 but got only half a season out of him as a two-way player within the first two years. Ohtani was diagnosed with a Grade 2 tear of his right UCL in June 2018 and was recommended Tommy John surgery in September, after PRP and stem-cell therapy did not take. He continued to hit through the end of the season and underwent Tommy John surgery in October, which kept him out of the lineup until May of the following season. Ohtani struggled mightily as a two-way player during the COVID-19-shortened season of 2020, then put together a three-year stretch that will go down as one of the most impressive in baseball history. As a hitter, Ohtani slashed .277/.379/.585 with 124 home runs, 290 RBIs and 57 stolen bases in 447 games. As a pitcher, he accumulated 34 wins and posted a 2.84 ERA in 428? innings, striking out 542 batters in the process. If not for a record-breaking home run season from Aaron Judge in 2022, he would have won three consecutive MVPs. ""He's a great player,"" Minasian said. ""Great player that can do things on a baseball field that nobody else can do. As good of a player as he is, the thing I appreciate the most is the preparation part of it. The want-to, the care. This is somebody that puts everything he has into it, and I have a ton of respect for that."" Ohtani hasn't spoken publicly since Aug. 9, his last full start before learning about his UCL tear when he next took the mound 14 days later. Ohtani found out about the injury shortly after an early exit from the first game of a doubleheader and was in the lineup for Game 2. He then accompanied the Angels on a three-city road trip through New York, Philadelphia and Oakland, serving as the team's designated hitter throughout. The oblique injury occurred hours before the first game of the ensuing homestand. Ohtani continually worked to be in the lineup nonetheless, getting scratched on a couple of occasions. Earlier this week, while the Angels were in Seattle, Minasian saw him in the batting cages ""taking massive hacks"" to test the injury as much as possible. ""He wants to play,"" Minasian said, ""and that's what we love about him."" Ohtani's elbow procedure will be decided on between him and his representation at CAA. The Angels, who will technically be his employer for only 2½ more weeks, haven't really been involved in that process. ""There's discussions, and once they lock something down, there will be communication,"" Minasian said. ""Sho and his group will handle that, determine what they wanna do and how they wanna do it, who they wanna do it with, and I respect that. I'll obviously have that information at some point. But definitely respect his decision.""",sports
Former Phillies manager Manuel suffers stroke,"Former Philadelphia Phillies manager Charlie Manuel, who led the club to the 2008 World Series title, suffered a stroke Saturday. The club said Manuel, 79, was undergoing a medical procedure in Florida when he had the stroke. Physicians were able to remove a blood clot. ""The next 24 hours will be crucial to his recovery, and Charlie's family asks that you keep him in your thoughts and prayers at this time,"" the team said in a release. Under Manuel, the Phillies won five consecutive National League East titles from 2007 to 2011. They beat the Tampa Bay Rays in the 2008 World Series for the city's first major professional sports championship since 1983. Philadelphia won another National League pennant in 2009 before losing to the New York Yankees in the World Series. Manuel was fired by the Phillies in 2013 after the club got off to a 53-67 start. He compiled a 1,000-826 record as a major league manager, including 780 wins with the Phillies. He was inducted into the team's wall of fame in 2014. Manuel rejoined the organization that year to work as a senior adviser to the general manager. Manuel also played six seasons in the majors as an outfielder with the Minnesota Twins and Los Angeles Dodgers from 1969 to '75. Reuters and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",sports
India vs Sri Lanka Predicted Playing 11 Asia Cup 2023 Final: Will Shreyas Iyer Play Today?,"All eyes will be on the playing 11 of Team India in the final of Asia Cup 2023 against Sri Lanka. India will be forced to make a change if the conditions are spin-friendly. That is because their left-arm spinner Axar Patel has been ruled out due to strain in his thigh. He sustained the injury in the last Super 4 stage match vs Bangladesh. Axar has been replaced by Washington Sundar, who is also a spin-bowling all-rounder. Sundar jetted off quickly to Sri Lanka after Axar got ruled out of the final on Saturday. Also Read | Colombo Weather Forecast: Will India Vs Sri Lanka Asia Cup Final Get CANCELLED Because Of Rain?

India goes head to head with Sri Lanka in the Asia Cup 2023 Finals, and the excitement is off the charts! ____ #AsiaCup2023 #INDvSL pic.twitter.com/pwsLM49YKE — AsianCricketCouncil (@ACCMedia1) September 16, 2023 It will be interesting to see how India manages the Shreyas Iyer situation. Iyer made a comeback in the Asia Cup and also played a game vs Pakistan. However, Iyer got injured ahead of the India vs Pakistan match in the Super 4s. Iyer's injury made KL Rahul's return to the XI possible in that match. Rahul hit a hundred to win the trust of the management and has done well since then. Ishan Kishan, at the same time, has produced good knocks. If Iyer is fit before the final, which looks like the case, will he get a game? If yes, who will he replace in the XI? That are some qustions which will be answered soon. India had rested as many as five players in the Bangladesh match. They were Virat Kohli, Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya, Kuldeep Yadav and Mohammed Siraj. They are most likely to return to the playing 11 for the final today in Colombo. Let's see who Sri Lanka pick in place of Theekshana. The mystery spinner has been brilliant in the powerplay overs and Sri Lanka will have to find an able replacement who can keep the Indian batters at bay in the first ten overs. India Probable Playing XI: Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Ishan Kishan, KL Rahul, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar/Shardul Thakur, Jasprit Bumrah, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Siraj Sri Lanka Probable Playing XI : Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Perera, Kusal Mendis(w), Sadeera Samarawickrama, Charith Asalanka, Dhananjaya de Silva, Dasun Shanaka(c), Dunith Wellalage, Pramod Madhushan/Dushan Hemantha, Kasun Rajitha, Matheesha Pathirana",sports

Asia Cup Final: India face Sri Lanka amid reports of inclement weather; what happens if the match is washed out?,"Synopsis Cricket enthusiasts and players alike will be keeping a close eye on the weather conditions in Sri Lanka, as rain may play a significant role in the outcome of this much-anticipated final of the Asia Cup. According to the latest weather updates for Sunday, there is a possibility of thunderstorms with scattered showers expected during the afternoon and evening. The weather conditions in Colombo have been consistent with cloudy and rainy skies throughout the 'Super 4' stage of the Asia Cup . This trend is thought to continue for the final showdown between India and Sri Lanka , scheduled for Sunday at the R. Premadasa Stadium. According to the latest weather updates, there is a possibility of thunderstorms with scattered showers expected during Sunday afternoon and evening. However, similar to the situation during the game between India and Pakistan in the 'Super 4' stage, the final has a reserve day in case rain disrupts the proceedings on Sunday. Both India and Sri Lanka emerged from the 'Super 4' stage with four points each, earning them a spot in the final. India secured the top position in the table thanks to their superior net run rate. In contrast, Bangladesh and Pakistan, which finished third and fourth, were eliminated from the tournament. CATCH ALL LIVE UPDATES OF INDIA VS SRI LANKA FINAL HERE The highly anticipated final is set to kick off at 3 p.m. local time, which aligns with 3 p.m. IST. Weather forecast for the day: Temperature: 32 degrees Celsius Conditions: Cloudy; a thundershower in parts of the area this morning followed by a couple of thunderstorms this afternoon Wind Gusts: 37 km/hr Probability of Precipitation: 90% Rain: 13.8 mm Cloud Cover: 96% Hours of rain: 3 Weather forecast for the afternoon: Temperature: 30 degrees Celsius Conditions: Cloudy with a couple of thunderstorms Wind Gusts: 37 km/hr Humidity: 77% Probability of Precipitation: 90% Rain: 12.2 mm Cloud Cover: 99% Weather forecast for the evening: Temperature: 27 degrees Celsius Conditions: Cloudy with a couple of thunderstorms Wind Gusts: 26 km/hr Humidity: 86% Probability of Precipitation: 90% Rain: 7.3 mm Cloud Cover: 99% Cricket enthusiasts and players alike will be keeping a close eye on the weather conditions, as rain may play a significant role in the outcome of this much-anticipated final. While the Lankans will go into the final as the defending champions, Team India, led by in-form Rohit Sharma, will be desperate to lift the trophy that they haven't won since 2018. Having secured qualification for the showpiece event, overcoming myriad challenges and close contests in the ICC World Cup Qualifiers, the Lankans would be keen not to cede the mantle of Asia's best to their sub-continental neighbours. A win in the all-important final on Sunday will certainly make them a dark horse in the World Cup, where the matches will be played on familiar sub-continental surfaces. Sri Lanka came close to handing India their first defeat of the Asia Cup 2023 in the Super Four stage but the visitors' bowling attack came to the party to eke out a hard-fought win.

World Patient Safety Day 2023: Things To Watch Out For Before Purchasing Medicines,"In an era where health takes center stage, making informed decisions about our medications is crucial. Every medicine you find on the pharmacy shelf comes with a label that holds valuable information. Understanding these labels can be the key to your well-being and safety. According to The Institute of Medicine, lack of patient understanding and subsequent unintentional misuse of medicines is the root cause of medication error, poor adherence and worse health outcomes. In this regard, Dr. Sumitra Agarwal, who is the Director of Artificial Eye Co, Kolkata said, ""Decoding medicine labels is an essential step before purchasing any medication. The first thing to scrutinize is the active ingredient, ensuring it matches your therapeutic needs and avoiding duplication if you're on multiple medications. Also, examine the warnings and precautions to be aware of potential side effects and interactions. Additionally, safety seals are paramount; their integrity ensures the product hasn't been tampered with."" Things To check Before Purchasing Medicines: Dr. Divya Singh, who is a Senior Surgeon at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, and Director of Maaiya Social Change Front Foundation listed down the things we should check before purchasing medicines: Active Ingredients: Know What You're Taking - The first and most critical information on any medicine label is the list of active ingredients. This section reveals the specific chemicals or compounds that make the medication work. Knowing the active ingredients is essential to avoid allergic reactions or interactions with other medications you may be taking. Dosage Instructions: Follow the Guidelines - Pay close attention to the dosage instructions provided on the label. It specifies how much medicine to take and how often. Following these guidelines is vital to ensure the medication's effectiveness and minimize the risk of side effects or overdosing. Expiration Date: Don't Use Outdated Medications - Always check the expiration date. Using medications past their expiration date can be ineffective or even harmful. Dispose of expired medications properly to ensure your safety. Usage Directions: Understand How to Take It - The label often includes usage directions, such as whether to take the medicine with food, water, or at a specific time of day. Comprehending these directions ensures that you get the maximum benefit from the medication. Warning and Precautions: Be Informed and Safe - Warnings and precautions provide vital information about potential side effects, special considerations, or situations where the medication should not be used. Read these carefully, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are pregnant or breastfeeding. Storage Conditions: Keep Medications Safe - Proper storage conditions are crucial for maintaining the effectiveness of your medicines. The label may specify whether to store the medication at room temperature, in the refrigerator, or away from light and moisture. Over-the-Counter vs. Prescription: Understand the Difference - Distinguish between over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medications. Since OTC medicines can be purchased without a prescription, it requires responsible use and awareness to avoid drug misuse or overdose. Consult Your Healthcare Provider - Ultimately, the best way to decode medication labels is to consult your healthcare provider or pharmacist. They can provide personalized guidance based on your medical history and ensure you make informed choices about your healthcare. Things To Keep In Mind Before Buying Medicines For Children: Dr. Narayanaswamy, who is a pediatrician, founder and Medical Director at Athreya Hospital said, ""Concerned parents must be extra cautious while buying pediatric medicines"" googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); He also laid down the following guidelines: At first avoid over the counter drugs and preferably consult a Pediatrician before buying drugs for them: Don't treat kids as tiny adults. Always seek medical advice from a pediatrician or some medical expert before giving any medication to your child. Ensure that the medication is suitable for your child's age and weight as pediatric dosages can vary significantly. Read the medication labels carefully: Confirm that it matches the doctor's prescription and your child's details, including name, age & weight. When giving liquid medications, use the provided measuring device (commonly a measuring cup, syringe or dropper is provided ) rather than household spoons to ensure accurate dosing. Avoid pinch or fist as a measure. Reconstitute the medication within the bottle provided and avoid taking powder outside and mixing it. Avoid giving multiple medications (including other fields of medicine like ayurvedic, homeopathic etc) simultaneously without consulting your doctor as some drugs can cause drug interactions. Strictly follow the dosing instructions as provided by your doctor carefully. Never exceed the recommended dose, and always stick to the prescribed timing. Some medications come in various flavours or forms (e.g., chewable tablets, syrups). Choose a form that your child can take comfortably. Pay attention to the recommended storage conditions (e.g., store in a cool, dry place). This helps maintaining the medication's effectiveness. Also store medicines out of reach of children to prevent accidental ingestion. Allergies : Before buying drugs inform your doctor or pharmacist about any allergies your child has to medications or substances. Double-check that the medicine does not contain any allergens. Possible Side Effects: Be aware of potential side effects and adverse reactions to the medication. Contact your pediatrician immediately if your child experiences any unusual symptoms. On concluding, Dr. Vinodh Kumar S, who is an MBBS, MD (Internal Medicine) Consultant Physician & Diabetologist at Connect & Heal said, "" Being cautious when purchasing medicines is crucial for your health as it can directly affect how you feel and how well you recover from an illness. To make sure you're on the right track, always check the name of the medicine carefully. Some medicines look or sound very similar to others, which can lead to confusion. Getting the wrong one can be harmful. Secondly, medicines that are close to expiring might not work either, so it's better to choose ones with a longer shelf life. Also, avoid buying medicines that have been banned or are known to be unsafe."" ""Moreover, double-check that the dose matches what your doctor prescribed. It's essential to get the right amount. Avoid medicines with damaged packaging or broken seals, as they might not be safe to use. Never use medicine without a prescription from a healthcare professional. They know what's best for your health. Lastly, always save your prescription and receipts to keep track of your medicines and ensure your safety throughout your treatment,"" he added.

Right then, we thought after a delayed start due to rain we would get to see some good cricket by both teams but it ended up being a very short first innings, with India bowling Sri Lanka out for 50 runs in 15.2 overs. Shocking right? It was a day to remember for the pacers as Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj and Hardik Pandya made sure they took all the 10 wickets. The target for India is 51 runs and they have 50 overs to get to it. The required run rate is just over 1. Grab a cup of coffee as we bring you the run chase soon. Until then, sit tight. The man of the moment, Mohammed Siraj, is in for a chat. He says that this feels like a dream. Mentions that he had a similar start against Sri Lanka in Trivandrum. Shares that he tried to keep it simple and looked to execute his lines and lengths. States that his intention was to make the batter play and draw him forward. Adds that he tries to swing the ball in white-ball cricket. There is nothing but praise for the Indian bowling unit. Jasprit Bumrah struck in the first over itself dismissing Kusal Perera for a duck. Mohammed Siraj took things into his hands in his 2nd over back and took 4 wickets. After that there was no recovery by the Lankans and the Indian bowlers were all over them. Mohammed Siraj completed his fifer by bowling over Dasun Shanaka, the opposition skipper followed by the wicket of Kusal Mendis in the same way. After that, it was Hardik Pandya who bowled a well-directed bouncer to dismiss Dunith Wellalage and gave India another breakthrough. Matheesha Pathirana and Pramod Madushan were sent back by him too ending the innings. A comprehensive performance by the bowlers and fielders did not allow Sri Lanka to go over the 50. We saw the pacers perform as expected along with some good catches by the fielders. Overall, India dominated Sri Lanka in the first innings. Honestly, not much to say about the batting of Sri Lanka. They were put on the back foot in the first over itself as Kusal Perera was dismissed for a duck. After that, they never seemed to be in control of the game at any point. The 4th over which was bowled by Mohammed Siraj bruised the Lankans badly as he dismissed Pathum Nissanka, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Charith Asalanka and Dhananjaya de Silva in the same over. 4-wickets in one over was a lot to recover from as by that time the Lankans were already 5-wickets down. The skipper, Dasun Shanaka was the next one to be dismissed for a duck by Siraj again. After that, the youngster Dunith Wellalage and Kusal Mendis tried to take control of the innings slowly but Kusal Mendis's innings came to an end after a long struggle. Dunith Wellalage was the next to walk back to the pavilion soon after which brought the tail out in the middle. Pramod Madushan and Matheesha Pathirana were cleaned up by Hardik Pandya in successive balls bringing an end to the innings. None of the batters except Kusal Mendis could cross the 15-run mark and 5 batters were dismissed for ducks. A very disappointing batting performance by Sri Lanka. Unbelievable from India! Hardik Pandya leads his team back to the pavilion after cleaning up the Lankans. The pacers had a good outing as they cleaned Sri Lanka up for 50 runs and just over 15 overs in the Asia Cup final 2023. Siraj destroyed the Lankan top order single-handedly and he looked on a different level today. 15.2 overs (0 Run) OUT! CAUGHT! Done and dusted in a flash! Hardik Pandya bowls this one back of a length around off. Matheesha Pathirana stays back and pushes tentatively at it. The ball goes off the outer half to the left of point where Ishan Kishan takes a good catch. Pathirana departs the first ball and Pandya ends up with three wickets. Sri Lanka have been bundled out for a meager total of 50! Matheesha Pathirana is the last man in. 15.1 overs (0 Run) OUT! EDGED AND TAKEN! Hardik Pandya gets his second wicket and Sri Lanka are now 9 down. Pandya goes full and wide outside off, inviting the drive. Pramod Madushan's eyes light up and he looks to smash it through the covers. Madushan gets a thick outside edge that flies to the first slip and Virat Kohli there takes a sharp catch with both hands falling on his back.",sports
"Gone For 50: India Avenge Sri Lanka After 23 Years, Shatter Records","Revenge is a dish best served cold. The Indian cricket team might be thinking on these lines after they dismissed Sri Lanka for 50 in the Asia Cup 2023 final in Colombo on Sunday. This is the lowest total in an ODI tournament final. Sri Lanka broke the forgettable record held by India for 23 years. India were dismissed for 54 by Sri Lanka in Sharjah in 2000 in the final of the Champions Trophy. This is also the lowest ODI total by any team against India. Till Sunday, Bangladesh's 58 at Mirpur in 2014 was the lowest total against India. India chased down the 51-run target win just 6.1 overs. As India won with 263 balls remaining, this is India's biggest ODI win for India. Their previous record was a win against Kenya in 2001 with 231 balls remaining. This is also the biggest win in an ODI tournament final in terms of balls remaining. Before Sunday, the record was held by Australia, who had beaten England in 2003 with 226 runs remaining. The architect of the miserly total was Mohammed Siraj , who became the fourth Indian to take six wickets in an ODI. He finished with figures of 6/21 - the second-best figures in Asia Cup history. He also took five wickets in 16 balls - the joint-quickest five wickets haul in ODIs. He also took four wickets in the fourth over - thus becoming the record-holder for most wickets in an over in ODIs. ""Feels like a dream. Last time I did the same against Sri Lanka at Trivandrum. Got four wickets early, couldn't get the five-for. Realised you get what's in your destiny. Did not try too much today. I have always looked for swing in white-ball cricket. Did not find much in the previous games. But today it was swinging, and I got more wickets with the out-swinger. Wanted to make the batters drive,"" Siraj said after the Sri Lanka innings ended. Talking about the match, Mohammed Siraj produced a magical spell, 6 for 21, to decimate Sri Lanka for 50, and place India on the brink of a victory in the Asia Cup final on Sunday. Sri Lanka elected to bat first after winning the toss, despite heavily overcast conditions, and the match started 40 minutes after the scheduled 3 PM beginning. But a storm of a different kind was awaiting Sri Lanka – a peak Siraj. His spell ensured that Lanka batted just 15.2 overs, and this was also their lowest ODI total against India. The pacer became only the fourth bowler in ODI history to take four wickets in an over, and he matched former Lankan pacer Chaminda Vaas as the fastest to a five-wicket haul in one-dayers. However, the beauty of Siraj bowling was beyond mere numbers. He got into action after Jasprit Bumrah jettisoned Kusal Perera in the third ball of the first over – a regulation caught behind. In conditions that resembled more London than Colombo, Siraj just had to pitch the ball in the right areas. Siraj made his dance of destruction in the 4th over – 3.1, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.6 balls. The victims were Pathum Nissanka , Sadeera Samaraiwickrama, Charith Asalanka and Dhananjaya De Silva. With PTI inputs",sports

There's no one backing up and the ball runs away to the fence for four extra runs. 13.1 overs (0 Run) That one came back a long way! Goes wider of the crease and bowls it on a good length wide of off, the ball pitches and just keeps coming back in. Dushan Hemantha looks to play at it but is beaten on the inside edge. 13.1 overs (1 Run) WIDE! On a good length and just sliding it down the leg side, wide called. 12.6 overs (0 Run) Ouch, Pramod Madushan has been hit flush on the helmet! Another attempted bouncer from Hardik Pandya, bowled on off and angling it in.

Pramod Madushan comes in at number 10. 12.3 overs (0 Run) OUT! CAUGHT! A well-directed bouncer from Hardik Pandya and he now gets into the wicket-taking act. This is bowled at around 132 clicks over leg stump but the height is good and Dunith Wellalage gets all tangled up. Wellalage tries to go deep in his crease and fend the ball but the ball takes the glove and lobs up in the air. KL Rahul comes forward a bit and pouches it safely.

Mohammed Siraj has his sixth wicket of the game! Pitches this one up on off stump, angling it in. Kusal Mendis looks a bit twitchy out there as he tries to go across the line once again but doesn't move his feet.

"WHO Pushing China To Give ""Full Access"" For Covid Investigators: Report","WHO Chif said the organisation had already written to China asking to ""give information."" (File) The head of the World Health Organization told the Financial Times he was ready to send a new mission of experts to China to investigate the origins of Covid-19. ""We're pressing China to give full access, and we are asking countries to raise it during their bilateral meetings -- (to urge Beijing) to co-operate,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the FT. He said the WHO had already written to China asking ""to give us information"" and for the organisation to send a team ""if they allow us to do so"". The international community has been unable to determine with certainty the origins of the Covid pandemic. The first cases were detected at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, suggesting two opposing theories: an escape from a laboratory in the city where such viruses were being studied or an intermediate animal that infected people at a local market. A team of specialists led by the WHO and accompanied by Chinese colleagues had investigated China in early 2021. In a joint report, they favoured the hypothesis that the virus had been transmitted by intermediary animal from a bat to a human, possibly at a market. Tedros said after that all options remained ""on the table"". There has not been a team able to return to China and WHO officials have repeatedly asked for additional data. Tedros has repeatedly said the WHO would not abandon its investigation and has called on Beijing for transparency in sharing data, carrying out investigations and sharing the results. The WHO lifted the highest alert level that had been in place for the pandemic earlier this year. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com Thanks to vaccines, post-infection immunity and better treatment, the virus is now under greater control, although with the arrival of autumn in the Northern Hemisphere, new variants are emerging.

"Brain-Eating Amoeba Kills US Boy: Toddler Gets Naegleria Fowleri Infection While Playing in Park in Arkansas, Dies","Mumbai, September 17: A tragic incident occurred as a baby boy died due to contracting a brain-eating amoeba while enjoying his time at a children's splash park. The young child, Michael Alexander Pollock III, was only 16 months old when he sadly passed away while playing at the park located in Little Rock, Arkansas. The Arkansas Department of Health has verified that young Michael was infected with the ""brain-eating"" naegleria fowleri amoeba. This marks the fifth reported case of someone succumbing to this illness in the United States this year. “Though Michael’s time on Earth was short, he touched the hearts of family, friends, and even strangers he came across with his illuminating smile and playfulness,” his obituary read. Brain-Eating Amoeba Kills US Boy: Two-Year-Old Gets Naegleria Fowleri Infection While Playing in Water in Nevada's Ash Springs, Dies . Tragically, the toddler died at Arkansas Children’s Hospital in Little Rock. Health officials released a statement explaining that the infection likely occurred when the individual was exposed at the splash pad of the Country Club of Little Rock. The Arkansas Health Department sent numerous samples from the pool and splash pad to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). According to the statement, the CDC has confirmed the presence of viable Naegleria Fowleri in one of the splash pad samples. Brain-Eating Amoeba Strikes Again: Teenage Girl in US Dies After Going for a Swim in Naegleria Fowleri-Infected Waters . Officials said that there is no more danger to the public from this exposure. The country club has closed the splash pad and is cooperating with investigations. Naegleria fowleri is a dangerous amoeba. It usually causes death. It lives in soil and warm freshwater like lakes, rivers, and hot springs. People sometimes call it a ""brain-eating amoeba"" because it can cause an infection in the brain. You can't get infected by drinking water. The amoeba has to go up your nose. At first, it causes severe headaches, fever, and makes a person feel like throwing up. This is called 'stage one' of the infection. (The above story first appeared on LatestLY on Sep 17, 2023 08:17 PM IST.

Testing times: On shrinking of India’s goods exports,"India’s goods exports shrank for the seventh consecutive time and the ninth time in 11 months this August, while imports surged to hit the highest level since March this year. At $58.6 billion, inbound shipments were still 5.2% below last August’s levels, but exports fell by a relatively steeper 6.9%, leading to a $24.2 billion trade deficit — the widest since October 2022. Goods exports are now down 11.9% so far this year and imports have dropped 12.1%. Services exports for last month will be known later, but Commerce Ministry extrapolations suggest that this engine that has been resilient so far through the global economic turmoil, is also beginning to feel the heat. For now, the 0.4% drop expected in services exports in August is minor and with intangible imports also likely dropping at a sharper pace, this will not exacerbate the trade balance yet. However, shrinking services exports imply that their ability to bridge the goods trade deficits that were up sharply last year, will be restricted, thus raising the possibility of wider current account deficits from this quarter. With global commodity prices rising around 12% from June levels to hit a 15-month high this month, the pressure on the goods trade deficit is likely to escalate, especially as oil and gems and jewellery imports have fallen less than their exports so far in 2023-24. In the first four months of this fiscal, about half the decline in outgoing shipments has been fuelled by petroleum despite volumes rising 6%, as prices fell 27%. This may change if global oil prices, which crossed $90 per barrel over the past week for the first time since November 2022, stay elevated. Export volumes of as many as 13 major items rose between April and July, but their value had declined owing to lower prices. That is a good omen about demand for Indian goods amid the gloom, and the government believes rising commodity prices will help trade tallies. But they could also be a double-edged sword for India as its strategic gambit to import more Russian oil has turned less lucrative. Moreover, sticky inflation could further dampen demand, especially in key markets such as the European Union, which just hiked interest rates to a record high. Inflation reheated in the United States last month, but not enough yet to dent festive demand that may lift order books in coming months. That engineering goods, which account for a quarter of India’s exports, clocked their first uptick after eight months in August, with half of the 14 key segments of exports growing — the best performance in nine months — is a welcome sign. India needs to do all it can to nurture precious green shoots and support exporters.",business
Sanctions for change: On America’s policy towards Iran,"A year after the death of Mahsa Amini, the 22-year-old Kurdish woman who was arrested by Iran’s morality police for allegedly flouting the country’s mandatory hijab rules, anti-government protests seem to have lost their momentum. But the theocratic regime remains vulnerable to more such shocks. The Islamic Republic, which is struggling with economic woes due to crippling American sanctions, has witnessed a wave of protests, with a demand for reforms, and at times, regime change. The protests triggered by the custodial death of Amini had rattled the regime initially, which had sent mixed signals on disbanding the infamous morality police force and altering the hijab laws. But it later recovered from the setbacks and tightened the crackdown on the protesters. According to rights organisations, more than 500 people, including 71 minors, have been killed in the unrest and hundreds wounded and arrested in the past year. Iran has also executed at least seven people linked to the protests. On the first anniversary of Amini’s death, there were reports of the security personnel detaining activists to prevent any kind of memorial events for the woman, whose name has emerged as a rallying cry for reforms and women’s freedoms in a country that has been tightly held by Shia Mullahs since the 1979 revolution. The Biden administration of the United States has imposed a new set of sanctions on the first anniversary of Amini’s death, targeting officials in Iran’s security apparatus. President Joe Biden and other officials have repeatedly called out rights violations. But the U.S.’s policy towards Iran has its own problems. First, while the sanctions have hit the Iranian economy hard, inflaming resentment, they have done little in changing the behaviour of the regime. Second, when it comes to protecting its interests, Washington has chosen to engage with the Mullahs, irrespective of its rhetoric over human rights. The U.S. and Iran are in an advanced stage of finalising a prisoner swap deal as part of which the U.S. would agree to transfer some $6 billion Iranian funds frozen in South Korean accounts to Qatar, which Tehran can tap for humanitarian purposes. Instead of this off-and-on hostility and engagement which is not helping the Iranian people, the West should adopt a more consistent policy of engagement and pressure to extract compromises from Iran in return for economic rewards. For the Mullahs, the recurring protests should serve as a reminder that a large section of the population has already turned hostile towards their reign. The protesters may not have attained a critical mass for now, but it may not remain so forever in a country with a history of radical revolutions if the underlying problems of economic crises, regime rigidity and lack of reforms are not addressed.",business
Marco Jansen Destroys Australian Top Order To Clinch Series For South Africa,"Left-arm fast bowler Marco Jansen dismissed the first five Australian batsmen to clinch a come-from-behind series win for South Africa in the fifth one-day international at the Wanderers Stadium on Sunday. Jansen took five for 39 as Australia were bowled out for 193 in reply to South Africa's 315 for nine. South African captain Temba Bavuma said the character of the team had shone through after they lost the first two matches of the series, which boded well for the World Cup in India next month. ""There is a lot of confidence we can take, in that we had our backs against the wall and we showed we have ways of getting on top of the game. We will go to India in probably the best state we can be."" South Africa won each of the last three matches by more than 100 runs after they were sent in to bat by Australian captain Mitchell Marsh . Marsh admitted: ""We were outplayed in the last three games but we have a one-day game in India on Friday, a lot of players coming back and a big World Cup coming up."" Several leading players, including regular captain Pat Cummins , fellow fast bowler Mitchell Starc , all-rounder Glenn Maxwell and star batsman Steve Smith, will join the team for a pre-World Cup series against India starting in Mohali on Friday. Marsh's decision to bowl first in the only day game of the series seemed justified on Sunday when his bowlers reduced South Africa to 103 for four in the 24th over on a pitch which offered sideways movement and bounce to the seamers. Player of the series Aiden Markram (93) and David Miller (63) put on 109 for the fifth wicket and lower order batsmen Jansen and Andile Phehlukwayo took the total past 300 with some big hitting towards the end. Jansen hit three sixes in scoring 47 off 29 balls and Phehlukwayo cleared the boundary four times in his unbeaten 39 off 19 deliveries. Marsh and David Warner blasted 34 off the first three overs of the Australian innings but Jansen came into the attack and dismissed Warner and Inglis in a double-wicket maiden over. Marsh (71) and Marnus Labuschagne (44) put on 90 for the third wicket but Jansen dismissed both set batsmen and Alex Carey in a burst of three wickets off seven balls to put South Africa in command.

Indian Football Team Departs For Asian Games 2023 Without Two Players,"Defenders Konsam Chinglensana Singh and Lalchungnunga did not accompany the Indian football team that left the country on Sunday for the Asian Games in China as their visa was not ready but a top IOA official said the duo will get their travel documents in a day or two. Chinglensana and Lalchungnunga were apparently not in the initial long list of 50 players submitted by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) for the Asian Games and hence they did get their accreditation even though they were named in the 22-member team named in the last minute. India's Asian Games contingent Chef de Mission Bhupinder Singh Bajwa allayed any fears of the two players missing out of the Asian Games. They will, however, not be available for the first match against China on Tuesday. ""I and AIFF president (Kalyan Chaubey) have applied for express visa for the two players with letter from the sports ministry and the visa should come by tomorrow or day after. The Chinese embassy said normal visa will take seven days but express visa approval takes just two days,"" Bajwa told PTI. ""They will go (to China) with the express visa and will get their accreditation there. So, there should not be any problem for the two players,"" he added. Earlier in the day, India head coach Igor Stimac had said that his team will face a formidable Chinese team on Tuesday after reaching the Games Village on Monday as the AIFF was able to stitch and second-rung squad in the last minute due to non release oh players by the Indian Super League clubs. After the match against China on September 19, India face Bangladesh (September 21) and Myanmar (September 24) in their group matches. The top two teams from the six groups will make it to the pre-quarterfinals, with four best-ranked third-placed sides also qualifying. Thirteen players were not released by their respective ISL clubs initially, including Sandesh Jhingan and first-choice goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu. A 17-member team with Sunil Chhetri as the only notable face was named initially. On Friday, the AIFF announced a revised squad of 22 after hectic parleys with Jhingan in it, besides two more senior players in Chinglensana Singh and Lalchungnunga.

"""Sorry That We Disappointed You"": Shanaka Apologizes To Sri Lankan Fans","Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka sounded discouraged after his team was hammered by 10 wickets in a one-sided Asia Cup 2023 final against India on Sunday and apologized to Sri Lankan fans for the teams lackluster display on the field. After speedster Mohammed Siraj's fiery spell decimated Sri Lanka, the opening duo of Shubman Gill and Ishan Kishan's fifty-run partnership helped India lift the Asia Cup trophy for the 8th time in style after beating co-hosts in the final at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Sunday. He expressed regret for losing the important final and thanked the crowd for showing up in great numbers to support the Sri Lankan team. ""I would like to thank the fans who came in numbers, really sorry that we disappointed you. We as cricketers really love you. And congratulations to the Indian team for the brand of cricket they're playing,"" Dasun Shanaka said in a post-match presentation. Leading the India fast bowling effort, Siraj ran through the Sri Lanka top-order in a dazzling performance in the summit clash. It just took a little more than two hours for India to win their 8th Asia Cup title in style. Men in Blue lifted the Asia Cup trophy after five years. Shanaka congratulated India on their win and had words of wisdom for Mohammed Siraj. ""It was an outstanding display of bowling from Siraj, credit to him how he approached the game. I thought it would be a good pitch for the batters, but the overcast conditions played a part and it was a tough, tough day. Of course, the application could have been better, could've tightened our technique a bit to settle down and free our arms in the middle period,"" Shanaka said. He also gave several of his players credit for their performance in this competition. He claimed to be a future celebrity and used the aliases Charith Asalanka, Kusal Perera, and Sadeera Samarawickrama. ""A positive takeaway is how Sadeera Samarawickrama and Kusal Mendis batted in the middle period in spinning conditions, as well as the way Charith Asalanka batted and he's handling that pressure well. In Indian conditions, these three will perform well and score heavily. Also Dunith Wellalage, Maheesh Theekshana, Matheesha Pathirana and the two other fast bowlers as well in Kasun Rajitha and Pramod Madushan, think they will do well in the coming World Cup. Without five main players, the good thing is we came to the final playing good sides. It's a good sign from where we began two years ago,"" he added. In a spectacular display of bowling prowess, Sri Lanka was bowled out for a mere 50 runs in just 15.2 overs, mainly due to Siraj's exceptional performance, claiming six wickets in seven overs. In response, India chased down the target in merely 37 balls by 10 wickets. This is the largest victory for India, by the number of balls remaining in the innings and also the biggest defeat for Sri Lanka.

Republicans eye short-term spending deal amid possible government shutdown,"Listen to Story With a looming in two weeks, House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Sunday said he would bring a defense spending bill to a vote ""win or lose"" this week, despite resistance from hardline fellow Republicans. McCarthy is struggling to bring fiscal 2024 spending legislation to the House floor, with Republicans fractured by conservative demands for spending to be cut to a 2022 level of $1.47 trillion - $120 billion below the spending on which McCarthy agreed with Biden in May. Late on Sunday, members of the hardline HHCaucus and the more moderate Main Street Caucus announced a deal on a short-term stopgap bill to keep the government open until October 31, but with a spending cut of more than 8% on agencies apart from the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs. The measure, which is unlikely to become law, also includes conservative restrictions on immigration and the U.S. border with Mexico. It does not include funding for Ukraine, which Biden had requested. have said that such a deal could allow the House to move forward on the defense spending bill this week. But it was unclear whether the measure had sufficient Republican support to pass the chamber. The spending cuts were also likely to draw opposition from Democrats in the House and Senate, who reject the immigration provisions. Republicans hold a narrow 221-212 majority in the chamber as they bicker over spending and pursue a new while the United States faces a possible fourth partial government shutdown in a decade. McCarthy has begun to face calls for floor action seeking his ouster from hardline conservatives and others who have accused him of failing to keep promises he made to become speaker in January after a revolt from some of the most conservative Republicans in the House. The Republican-controlled House and Democratic-led Senate have until Oct. 1 to avoid a partial shutdown by enacting appropriations bills that Biden, a Democrat, can sign into law, or by passing a short-term stopgap spending measure to give lawmakers more time for debate. McCarthy signaled a tougher stand with hardliners, telling the Fox News ""Sunday Morning Futures"" program that he would bring the stalled defense bill to the floor this week. The House last week postponed a vote on beginning debate on the defense appropriations bill due to opposition from the hardliners. ""We'll bring it to the floor, win or lose, and show the American public who's for the Department of Defense, who's for our military,"" McCarthy said. McCarthy also said he wants to make sure there is no shutdown on Oct. 1, saying: ""A shutdown would only give strength to the Democrats."" McCarthy has held closed-door discussions over the weekend aimed at overcoming a roadblock by the conservative hardliners to spending legislation. They want assurances that legislation will include their deep spending cuts, as well as conservative policy priorities including provisions related to tighter border security that are unlikely to secure Democratic votes. ""We made some good progress,"" McCarthy said. Representative Elise Stefanik, the No. 4 House Republican, told the ""Fox News Sunday"" program that she was optimistic about moving forward on appropriations after closed-door discussions. But Republican Representative Nancy Mace told ABC's ""This Week"" that she expects a shutdown and did not rule out support for a vote to oust McCarthy's ouster. Mace complained that the speaker has not made good on promises to her involving action on women's issues and gun violence. ""Everything's on the table at this point for me,"" Mace said. Mace played down the consequences of a shutdown, saying much of the government would remain in operation and that the hiatus would give government workers time off with back pay at a later date. Democratic former House Speaker said a shutdown would risk harming the most vulnerable members of society who depend on government assistance. ""We're talking about diminishing even something as simple and fundamental as feeding the children,"" Pelosi told MSNBC. ""We have to try to avoid it.""

"Alabama school band director stunned, arrested for refusing to end performance","Listen to Story An Alabama high school band director was shocked with a stun gun and arrested after Birmingham police said he wouldn’t tell his band to stop playing. Local news outlets report that Minor High School’s band director was arrested Thursday night after a football game between Minor and Jackson-Olin High School. He’s charged with disorderly conduct, harassment and resisting arrest. Birmingham Police Officer Truman Fitzgerald, a department spokesperson, said police were trying to clear the stadium at Jackson-Olin after the game and asked both bands to stop playing so people wouldn’t linger. Police say the Jackson-Olin band stopped performing, but that the director disregarded officers and told his students to keep playing. Police officers accompanied by school security guards went to arrest him for disorderly conduct but he got into a scuffle with them, Fitzgerald said. He said the band director refused to place his hands behind his back and shoved an officer. One of the officers shocked the band director with a stun gun. Paramedics treated the band director and took him to a hospital to be checked out, Fitzgerald said. He was later booked into jail and released after posting bail. Jefferson County School Superintendent Walter Gonsoulin said Friday that he’s gathering facts and declined further comment for now. “I urge everyone not to jump to conclusions,” Gonsoulin said.

Vivek Ramaswamy says 'many annoyed by my rise' after ex-employees' exposé,"Listen to Story Indian-American Vivek Ramaswamy, a Republican aspirant for the US Presidential race, said many people find his rise unsettling because of his young age. The statement comes after some former employees from his ventures leader in private. “The reality is many people are annoyed by my rise and believe that a 38-year-old is too young to be US President. The fact of the matter is Thomas Jefferson was 33 years old when he wrote the US Declaration of Independence. He also invented the swivel chair while he was at it, by the way,” Ramaswamy said during an interview with Fox News on Sunday. The 38-year-old's popularity has surged after his performance in the initial as per opinion polls, though the criticism by opponents is also increasing. “Well, look, we have been taking intense criticism, over the last several weeks since I performed well on that second debate. And this is part of the process, so I invite the open debate,” he said. Ramaswamy said it will take ""someone whose best days ahead are still yet ahead in life"" to revive the spirit of the country. ""And I do believe that the United States of America can see our best days still yet ahead. But we can’t just be running from something,"" he said. He asserted that the radical Biden agenda is the wrong place to focus, and that is why he would rather not criticise it. ""Of course, there’s a lot to criticize. But we have to offer a vision of our own, not just what we are running from. What are we running to -- revive meritocracy, the pursuit of excellence, economic growth, free speech, open debate -- are basic values that most Americans still agree with,” he said. He said he is confident that his party has a chance to deliver a 1980-style, Ronald Reagan-style, moral mandate. ""That is how we’ll unite this country. And I’m in this race because I think I am the single best positioned candidate to do it. And even though we’ve taken criticisms from basically nearly every other candidate that’s been threatened by my rise, I’m not running against any of them. I am running for this country. That’s the mission we’re guided by,” Ramaswamy said. Ramaswamy earlier if he wins the race for the White House, though he has himself used it 29 times. The H-1B visa, the most sought-after among Indian IT professionals, is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations.

US national security advisor holds 'constructive' talks with Chinese minister,"Listen to Story White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Malta for hours this weekend, Beijing and Washington said on Sunday, as the world's two largest economies seek to stabilize troubled relations. Both sides held ""candid, substantive and constructive"" talks during multiple meetings held Sept. 16-17, according to separate statements from the White House and the Chinese foreign ministry published on Sunday. There were also ""limited"" early signs that severed military communications between the two sides may start to be restored, a senior Biden administration official said. Chinese officials did not comment on the prospect of military-to-military communication. Sullivan's meeting with Wang was the latest in a series of high-level discussions between U.S. and Chinese officials that could lay the groundwork for a meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping later this year. They come amid a string of upheavals in the Chinese government's top ranks, including the disappearance of defense minister Li Shangfu, and wobbles in the country's economy that have caused consternation in foreign capitals. The Malta talks spanned about 12 hours over the two days, a senior Biden administration official told reporters. Sullivan last met Wang in Vienna in May. China's foreign ministry said both sides agreed to maintain high-level exchanges and hold bilateral consultations on Asia-Pacific affairs, maritime affairs and foreign policy. The United States told China it was ready to work together on counter-narcotics, artificial intelligence and climate change even as it expressed concerns over unspecified Chinese support for Russia and Beijing recently sending fighter jets across the sensitive median line of the Taiwan Strait, the U.S. official said. Wang cautioned the United States that the Taiwan issue is the ""first insurmountable red line of Sino-U.S. relations,"" according to the Chinese foreign ministry statement. China claims the self-ruled island as its own territory. The U.S. official said ""there have been some small or limited indications"" that Beijing is ready to re-open some cross-military communications used to de-escalate conflict between the two countries after those ties were cut following an Aug. 2022 visit by former U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan that enraged China. In its statement, the White House strongly suggested that more meetings are to come between the U.S. and China, adding that both sides ""committed to maintain this strategic channel of communication and to pursue additional high-level engagement and consultations in key areas ... in the coming months."" Biden this month expressed disappointment that Xi skipped a summit of Group of 20 leaders in India, but said he would ""get to see him."" The next likely opportunity for Biden to hold talks with Xi is an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco in November, where U.S. aides for months have hoped to stage such a meeting. U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Biden climate envoy John Kerry have traveled to China this year to thaw relations and ensure continued communication between the two countries amid tensions that flared after the U.S. military shot down a Chinese surveillance balloon that traveled over the United States. Biden and Xi last met in 2022 on the sidelines of a G20 summit on Indonesia's resort island of Bali.",world
Explosions heard as Ukraine launches special operation in Russia-held Sevastopol,"Listen to Story Ukrainian media outlets quoted intelligence sources as saying explosions reported in the Crimean city of Sevastopol on Sunday were due to a joint operation by its forces but a Moscow-installed official said Russia's enemies were trying to claim false victory. Mikhail Razvozhayev, the Moscow-installed governor of Sevastopol, home to Russian's Black Sea Fleet, said on Telegram that everything was calm in his city, the largest in Crimea. He also said no damage was done when Russian air defences brought down three Ukrainian drones in the area on Sunday. Razvozhayev said that if people saw smoke in the South Bay area it was due to harmless aerosol camouflage being used by the Black Sea Fleet. ""Our enemies today will try with all their might to pass it off as a 'victory,'"" he wrote on the Telegram messaging app. Reuters could not independently verify accounts of events on the peninsula, including explosions reported in Sevastopol by Telegram accounts which Ukrainian media quoted intelligence sources as saying were due to a joint operation by Ukraine's GUR military intelligence and the country's Navy. ""The planned work of the GUR and Navy continues,"" the Ukrainska Pravda news site quoted an unnamed intelligence source as saying. The website of the Suspilne public broadcaster, which quoted unnamed intelligence sources as giving a similar account, also said a marine radio engineering unit and radio engineering station with 12 radar antennas were based at Cape Fiolent, a landmark on Crimea's southern coast near Sevastopol.",world
"Key village near Bakhmut ‘cleared of Russians’, says Ukrainian commander","Listen to Story President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday his forces had recaptured an eastern village on the , in what would be Ukraine's second significant gain in three days in its gruelling counteroffensive against the Russian army. ""Today I would like to particularly commend the soldiers who, step by step, are returning to Ukraine what belongs to it, namely in the area of Bakhmut,"" Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation. The heavy fight for the Klishchiivka village, spread on higher grounds about 9 km south of Bakhmut, has taken weeks and comes after Kyiv said on Friday it had gained control of a tiny nearby village of Andriivka. The gains have been among the most significant in Ukraine's counteroffensive, which began in June and has struggled to break through entrenched Russian lines. who is also in operational control of the counteroffensive, posted a video of Ukrainian forces displaying the blue and yellow national flag on ruined buildings with the sound of fighting in the background. ""Klishchiivka was cleared of the Russians,"" Syrskyi, who has often visited the Bakhmut frontline to devise strategy and boost the troops' morale, said on the Telegram messaging app. Reuters could not verify the Ukrainian reports and there was no immediate comment from Moscow. On Sunday, Russia's defence ministry said in its daily briefing that its forces kept up their attacks near Klishchiivka, which had a pre-war population of around 400. Ukrainian military analysts said this week the liberation of settlements near Bakhmut would allow the military to advance from the southern flank in the Bakhmut area. ""Ukraine always gets its own back,"" Zelenskyy's chief of staff Andriy Yermak wrote on the Telegram. Zelenskyy thanked the successful units which he said were the 80th airborne assault brigade, the 5th assault brigade, the ""glorious 95th"" and a national police assault brigade. Ilia Yevlash, spokesperson for Ukrainian troops in the east, said the battle inflicted ""powerful damage"" on Russian airborne units, the ""Akhmat"" battalion of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, Storm-Z made up of Russian criminals, the Russian General Staff's military intelligence, and motorised rifle units. ""So, now we have gained a base that will allow us to continue to develop offensive actions and liberate our land from the invaders,"" Yevlash wrote on Telegram. Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said Russia was still trying to regain lost positions at the village. ""Today we had to fight off enemy attacks all day,"" she said. Russia has been in control of Klishchiivka since January. Moscow still controls large swaths of Ukraine's land in the east and south. Klishchiivka, just like Andriivka and other settlements in eastern Ukraine, has been turned into ruble in the long months of the fight for Bakhmut, which fell into Russian hands in May.",world

4 Greek rescue workers dead after bus hits vechicle in flood-stricken Libya,"Listen to Story Four Greek rescue workers dispatched to Libya following devastating were killed in a road collision Sunday, Libya’s health minister said. Some 11,300 people died when two dams collapsed during Mediterranean storm Daniel last week, sending a wall of water gushing through the city, according to the Red Crescent aid group. A further 10,000 people are missing and presumed dead. Rescue workers from Greece, Turkey, Egypt and other countries have flocked to the decimated port city to offer help. On Sunday, a bus carrying 19 Greek rescue workers collided with a vehicle carrying five Libyan nationals on the road between the cities of health minister Othman Abduljaleel said at a news conference. Three Libyans in the oncoming vehicle were also killed. Seven of the surviving Greek rescue workers were in critical condition, the minister said. In a parallel statement, the Greek Foreign Ministry acknowledged the crash but said only three of its nationals had died while two others were missing. The Associated Press was not immediately able to reconcile the conflicting reports. The disaster has brought some rare unity to oil-rich Libya, which has been divided between rival governments in the country’s east and west that are backed by various militia forces and international patrons. Residents from the nearby cities of Benghazi and Tobruk have offered to put up the displaced, while volunteers have helped hunt for survivors buried beneath the rubble. But the opposing governments have struggled to respond to the crisis. Their recovery efforts have been hampered by confusion, difficulty getting aid to the hardest-hit areas, and the destruction of Derna’s infrastructure, including several bridges. More than 3,283 bodies were buried as of Sunday, Abduljaleel said, many in , while others were transferred to nearby towns and cities. On Saturday, Libya’s general prosecutor, al-Sediq al-Sour, opened an investigation into the collapse of the two dams, built in the 1970s, as well as the allocation of maintenance funds. Derna’s mayor, Abdel-Moneim al-Gaithi, was suspended pending an investigation into the disaster. Authorities and aid groups have voiced concern about the spread of waterborne diseases and shifting of explosive ordnance from Libya’s recent conflicts. Haider al-Saeih, head of Libya’s center for combating diseases, said in televised comments Saturday that at least 150 people had suffered from diarrhea after drinking contaminated water in Derna. To prevent disease outbreak, Abduljaleel said his ministry had began “vaccinations against diseases that usually occur after disasters such as this one.”",world
26 cops among several hurt as stones thrown at Eritrean festival in German city,"Listen to Story German police said dozens of people, including at least 26 officers, were injured during unrest surrounding an Eritrean cultural festival in the southwestern city of Stuttgart. Shortly before the event was set to begin Saturday afternoon, around 200 protesters gathered in the area outside and began throwing stones, bottles, and other items at police officers and participants of the event. Six of the 26 injured police officers were treated in a hospital for their injuries, police said. Four event participants and two protesters were also injured, according to police, although information wasn’t immediately available about the severity of their injuries. Saturday’s protests were the latest in a string of unrest surrounding Eritrean cultural events in Germany and elsewhere. In July, a clash at an Eritrean festival in the western German city of Giessen left 22 police officers injured. A fight between Eritrean government supporters and opponents in Tel Aviv in early September led to one of the most violent street confrontations among African asylum seekers and migrants in the city’s recent memory. The event Saturday was organized by several groups considered close to the government of Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki. Tens of thousands of people have fled Eritrea for Europe, many alleging they were mistreated by Isaias’ repressive government. The conflicts surrounding gatherings like Saturday’s highlight the deep divide among members of the Eritrean diaspora, those who remain close to the government and those who have fled to live in exile and strongly oppose Isaias. On Saturday, Stuttgart police vice president Carsten Hoefler condemned the protesters’ actions and said in a statement that “neither the extent nor the intensity of the violence was apparent in advance.” City officials said there had been no reason to ban the gathering in advance, but that they will take steps to prevent similar unrest in the future. “We must take decisive action against the emergence of conflicts from other states on German soil,” said Stuttgart Mayor Frank Nopper, according to German news agency dpa.",world

"Weapons and vodka: Kim Jong Un wraps up Russia trip, takes home ‘explosive’ gift","Listen to Story North Korean leader Kim Jong Un left Russia on Sunday after a rare six-day visit that appeared to solidify his country's ties with President Vladimir Putin, fanning Western fears that Pyongyang could provide Moscow with weapons for its assault on Ukraine. Kim's tour of Russia's Far East, which began on Tuesday, has focused intensely on military cooperation, including a symbolic exchange of rifles with Putin and an inspection of state-of-the-art Russian weapons. Kim's first official visit abroad since the coronavirus pandemic has sparked concerns that Moscow and Pyongyang will defy Western sanctions to secure an arms deal that could help the Kremlin continue its assault against Ukraine. In comments broadcast on national television on Sunday, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russia will pursue cooperation with North Korea despite UN sanctions. ""We did not announce sanctions against North Korea, the Security Council did,"" he said. ""We will be developing equal, fair interaction with the DPRK,"" Lavrov said, using North Korea's official name. Before departing from Vladivostok, the Pacific port city just over the border, Kim was presented with five explosive drones, a reconnaissance drone and a bulletproof vest as gifts from the governor of the Primorye region, which borders China and North Korea. He also visited the Far Eastern State University and appeared particularly pleased as he watched a walrus show at a local oceanarium. Summing up the North Korean leader's visit, Russian Natural Resources Minister Alexander Kozlov, who accompanied him, said ""a lot"" had been discussed. ""Kim Jong Un was very interested in and paid attention to minute details,"" Kozlov said. He made no mention of any agreements concerning military matters, but said the two sides discussed increasing supplies of grain and the resumption of regular air travel. The two countries also discussed reviving long-muted infrastructure projects, he said. Government officials from the two countries also agreed to meet in Pyongyang in November, Kozlov added. At the end of Kim's visit, official Russian video footage showed him waving goodbye from his heavily armoured train to a Russian delegation, before the Russian march ""Farewell of Slavianka"" was played as the train departed. Russia and North Korea, historic allies, are both under rafts of global sanctions -- Moscow for its Ukraine offensive, Pyongyang for its nuclear weapon tests. On Saturday, Kim met Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu in Vladivostok, where he inspected state-of-the-art weapons including a hypersonic missile system. The pair were seen smiling as they inspected some of Russia's nuclear bombers at an airfield before boarding a warship. North Korean news agency KCNA later published pictures of a smiling Kim wearing a traditional Russian fur hat and raising a glass of vodka with Shoigu and their delegations.

"Head To Miss First Half Of WC, Labuschagne Back in Australia's Plans","A fracture in the left hand has ruled out Australia batter Travis Head from the first half of the World Cup in India with his participation in the rest of the tournament also uncertain, leaving the door open for the inclusion of in-form Marnus Labuschagne. The opener was struck on the left glove by a short delivery from Proteas seamer Gerald Coetzee in the fourth ODI against South Africa last week. Head coach Andrew McDonald revealed that Head, who will miss the three-match ODI series against India beginning on Friday, doesn't require surgery but the Australian selectors need to deliberate on the risk of ""carrying"" him in the World Cup squad. ""The timeframe is still a bit loose at the moment but the good news is he doesn't require surgery as it sits at the moment. There will be an extended period of time out and we've just got to weigh up whether that time (out) falls with an option to carry him through the front half of the World Cup,"" McDonald said. ""There's no doubt he won't be available for the front half, so that's a decision we'll have to make for the final 15. But I can't give you an exact time frame."" The World Cup starts on October 5 with the final scheduled for November 19. Head's injury leaves the door ajar for Labuschagne, who did not make Australia's 15-member provisional squad. However, the Test star put up tremendous display in the ODIs against South Africa, finishing as the leading run-scorer. ""I can't talk on behalf of the selection panel and lock him away in the World Cup 15 but it's no doubt looking likely,"" McDonald said. ""He's made a significant shift in his intent at the crease and putting the bowlers under pressure (more) than he was potentially 12 months ago. He's struck at around 100 strike-rate in this series. ""We know Marnus is a quality player and he probably didn't have the 12-18 months in one-day cricket that he would have liked. ""But he's no doubt taken that opportunity with both hands and there's no doubt he'll be front and centre when it comes to that 15-man squad down the track,"" he added. In Head's absence, Mitchell Marsh is likely to be elevated to the opening position. Advertisement Australia take on India in Chennai on October 8 in their World Cup opener. The last date to make changes to the squad is September 28, post which any changes would need approval from the ICC.

"PM Narendra Modi Special Parliament Session Highlights: Presence of women in parliament not significant before, but they contributed to both houses","Synopsis Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the lower house of parliament during a special session, bidding farewell to the historic building and highlighting its significance to India's democracy. He emphasized that while the new parliament building will be the future, the old building will continue to inspire future generations. Modi also praised the success of the G20 summit and Chandrayaan-3 mission, emphasizing India's strength and contribution. He acknowledged the growing presence and contributions of women in parliament and discussed the government's agenda for the special session, including bills on election commissioners, advocates, press, and post offices. PTI Prime Minister Narendra Modi Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said that as the new Parliament gets working from tomorrow, the old building will continue to inspire the upcoming generations. PM Modi said this while addressing the lower house of the parliament during the special parliament session. ""From the cash-for-votes scandal during the tenure of former PM Manmohan Singh to the abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019, this Parliament has witnessed it all:,"" said PM Modi in Lok Sabha. Here are the key highlights of the PM's speech in Lok Sabha in Parliament Special Session : Shifting to the new building Bidding adieu to this Parliament building is an emotional moment All of us are saying goodbye to this historic building. The decision to construct this building was taken by foreign rulers but we can never forget and can proudly say that the toil, the hard work and the money that went into the construction was that of my countrymen We may go to the new parliament building, but the old building will inspire the next generations From Nehru, Shastri to Vajpayee, many leaders have presented their vision of India in this Parliament Many tears have been shed in the Parliament. Nehru, Shastri and Indira Gandhi lost their lives during their tenure. We bid them adieu with tears in our eyes Today as we leave this building, I would also like to remember some journalists who dedicated their lives to the Parliament There was a terror attack (on the Parliament). This was not an attack on a building. In a way, it was an attack on the mother of democracy, on our living soul. Rembering Past Leaders The echo of Pandit (Jawahlal) Nehru's 'at the stroke of midnight' in this Parliament will continue to inspire us. This parliament where Atal Ji said 'sarkaren ayyengi, jayengi; partiyan banegi, bigedgi; magar ye desh rahna chahiye' Babasaheb Ambedkar tried bringing world's best practices to India, and India is today benefitting from it G20 and Chandrayaan-3 The success of the G20 is of 140 crore Indians, it is the success of Bharat. It is not a success of an individual or a political part I once again congratulate our scientists and praise them (for the success of Chandrayaan-3) Many people have a tendency of being suspicious about India. This time too (referring to the G20), they were confident that there will be no declaration. However, it is India's strength that it happened India will be proud that when it was the president (of the G20), the African Union became its member. Contribution of Women in Parliament Initially, the presence of women in the parliament was not very significant, but with time our mothers and sisters have contributed a lot to both houses The Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners Appointment Bill is listed on the government's agenda for Parliament's special session starting September 18. Three other bills listed on the agenda are Advocates (Amendment) Bill, Press and Registration of Perodicals Bill and Post Office Bill. Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

"Tim Burton reacts to ‘Superman Lives’ nod in ‘The Flash’, says he is in ‘quiet revolt’ against studios","Director Tim Burton says he’s “in quiet revolt” against the use of AI by Hollywood studios, which can be unleashed to “culturally misappropriate” past franchises and icons. In a recent interview with the British Film Institute (BFI), Burton talked at length about his expansive career and key shifts in the entertainment industry. He suggested he wasn’t thrilled by his former collaborators Nicholas Cage and Michael Keaton’s cameos as Superman and Batman respectively in Andy Muschietti’s The Flash (2023). In the 90s, Burton came close to directing Superman Lives , a deconstructionist take on the popular American superhero featuring Cage in the title role. The film, however, was scrapped by Warner Bros. a few weeks before it went on floors. It has since been dissected as one of the great unmade films in cinema history. In The Flash , Cage makes a surprise appearance as his character from Superman Lives . The DCEU film also features Michael Keaton as Batman, whom Burton had directed in two cult superhero movies, 1990’s Batman and 1992’s Batman Returns . Both films were produced by Warner Bros. In his BFI interview, Burton said he does not regret the cancellation of his legendary Superman film. “No, I don’t have regrets,” Burton was quoted as saying. “I will say this: when you work that long on a project and it doesn’t happen, it affects you for the rest of your life. Because you get passionate about things, and each thing is an unknown journey, and it wasn’t there yet. But it’s one of those experiences that never leaves you, a little bit.” He expanded this into a reflection on the use of AI in Hollywood, in an apparent reference to multiverse-style films like The Flash . “But also it goes into another AI thing, and this is why I think I’m over it with the studio. They can take what you did, Batman or whatever, and culturally misappropriate it, or whatever you want to call it. Even though you’re a slave of Disney or Warner Brothers, they can do whatever they want. So in my latter years of life, I’m in quiet revolt against all this,” Burton told BFI. However, filmmaker Kevin Smith, who had written the unfilmed screenplay of Superman Lives , recently praised Cage’s cameo in The Flash . “I finally got to see Nic Cage be Superman. It has been an absolute delight for me,” Smith was quoted as telling Rolling Stone. “It’s mind-melting. One of the first things I thought when I saw it at the premiere is, ‘Goddammit, (the giant spider) would have worked.’ As much as I used to make fun of ( Superman Lives producer) Jon Peters, that looked badass.”",entertainment
TIFF 2023 | 'American Fiction' wins People's Choice award,"Cord Jefferson's American Fiction , a biting satire starring Jeffery Wright as a disillusioned academic, has won the People's Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival, a much-watched bellwether in the Oscar race. American Fiction is the directorial debut of Jefferson, the veteran TV writer of Watchmen and Succession , and an adaptation of Percival Everett's 2001 novel Erasure . The film, about an author who resents that the literary industry is only interested in “Black books” that cater to the stereotypes of white audiences, emerged as a breakout hit at TIFF. Toronto's audience award winner, voted on by festival attendees, has historically nearly always signified a best-picture contender at the Academy Awards. Since 2012, every People's Choice winner at TIFF has gone on to score a best-picture nod. In 2018, when Green Book won, it announced the film as a surprise awards contender. (Peter Farrelly's film went on to win best picture at the Oscars.) Last year, Steven Spielberg's The Fabelmans won Toronto's top prize. First runner-up went to Alexander Payne's The Holdovers , starring Paul Giamatti as a curmudgeonly boarding school teacher tasked with staying with a handful of students over Christmas break in the 1970s. Second runner-up was Hayao Miyazaki's The Boy and the Heron , the long-awaited latest Studio Ghibli film from the Japanese anime master. American Fiction , which MGM will release in theaters November 3, co-stars Sterling K. Brown, Issa Rae and Tracee Ellis Ross. In an interview, Jefferson said he immediately connected with Everett's book. ALSO READ: TIFF 2023 | A new documentary reexamines the Louis CK scandal, 6 years later “I was having the exact same conversations with Black colleagues in both professions: Why are we always writing about misery and trauma and violence and pain inflicted on Blacks?"" said Jefferson. ""Why is this what people expect from us? Why is this the only thing we have to offer to culture?” The Toronto International Film Festival, which wrapped up on Sunday, was diminished this year due to the ongoing actors and writers strikes. Red-carpet premieres were mostly without movie stars, detracting from some of the buzz that the largest film festival in North American typically generates. The People's Choice winner for documentary went to Robert McCallum's Mr. Dressup: The Magic of Make-Believe and the midnight madness award went to Larry Charles' Dicks: The Musical . The festival's juried competition awards were given to Tarsem Singh Dhandwar's Dear Jassi , winner of the Platform section, and Meredith Hama-Brown's Seagrass , which took the FIPRESCI award from international critics.",entertainment
Calling All Paneer Tikka Lovers! 4 Fantastic Ways To Prepare It,"Paneer tikka is one of those snacks that you'll easily find everywhere. Whether you're at a dinner party or a wedding, it always finds its way onto the menu. And why not? Soft paneer cubes marinated with flavourful masalas make it an absolute delight to indulge in. However, the only downside to this snack is that it's traditionally prepared in a tandoor, which gives it its distinct taste. Now, of course, it's practically impossible to have a tandoor at home. This is why we end up ordering it from outside. But when made fresh at home, it offers an even more incredible flavour. To help you out, we'll be sharing four different ways in which you can make this delectable snack at home. Check them out below: Also Read: Weekend Special: How To Make Amritsari Paneer Tikka In Just 30 Mins The simplest way to cook paneer tikka at home is on the stovetop. All you have to do is heat a tawa and apply some oil to it. Now, arrange your marinated paneer tikkas on a skewer and place them on it. You could even keep them as is, but arranging them on a skewer makes it easier to grill directly over the flame. Once they are almost done, remove them from the tawa and grill them directly on the flame to give them that distinct charred effect. The results are truly spectacular! Microwaves have always made our lives easier, and it comes as no surprise that you can make this scrumptious snack in them as well. Marinate the paneer as you normally would and arrange it nicely on a microwave-friendly plate. Brush with some oil and cook for around 5-7 minutes. Once done, flip the paneer cubes and cook again for another 2-3 minutes. You'll have the classic paneer tikka oozing with flavours ready in just under 10 minutes. To get started, here's an easy recipe for making paneer tikka in the microwave. Also Read: Garlic Paneer Tikka Recipe: A Delicious Twist On A Classic Dish Paneer tikka can also be made in an oven. For this, make sure to always preheat your oven. Now, cover the baking tray with aluminium foil and arrange the paneer tikka skewers on it evenly. We don't want them to stick to each other. Brush with some oil and grill for around 10-12 minutes. Place it on the middle rack, as placing it on the top may end up making them too dry, and if placed on the lower one, they might not cook properly. So, the middle rack works best. Once done, brush again with oil and enjoy with chutney. An air fryer works exceptionally well to cook paneer tikka. Just like how we preheat the oven, it's important to preheat your air fryer as well. Now, just brush some oil in the air fryer basket and place the marinated paneer cubes in it. Air fry them for around 10 to 12 minutes, or until done. If you wish to make it healthier, you can even skip adding the oil. This way of preparing paneer tikka is super easy to make, and the results are just the same as the one cooked in a tandoor. Here's a recipe for you to try. Whip up scrumptious paneer tikka at home using any of the above-mentioned methods. Let us know which one works best for you in the comments below.",health
Asia Cup 2023: Who Is The Man Who Got To Lift The Trophy Bagged By India. Hint- He's Not A Player Or Coach,"googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); India had a dream run in Asia Cup 2023. There were a lot of uncertainties in the team heading into the continental tournament but by the time the Men in Blue emerged as the champions of Asia, they had ticked more boxes than otherwise. India beat Sri Lanka at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Sunday (September 17) to lift Asia Cup trophy for the eighth time. Even though it was the home team who had won the toss and elected to bat first, India bowled them out for mere 50 with Mohammed Siraj being the pick of the bowlers, scalping 6 for 21 off his 7 overs. Rohit Sharma & Co. then decided to try out a new opening pair, sending Ishan Kishan as Shubman Gill's opening partner. The duo raced to India's target in 6.1 overs, ensuring that all the 10 wickets remain intact and the team register their biggest win in terms of balls remaining. Later, when India was handed over their winning trophy, Tilak Varma was one of the first ones to lay his hand on the trophy which has been a tradition in the Indian team of the youngest member lifting the trophy.

Root Added To England Squad For First ODI vs Ireland At His Own Request,"Former England Test skipper Joe Root has been added to England's first ODI squad against Ireland at Headingley at his own request. England's initial squad didn't include a single player from their provisional ODI World Cup squad for the three-match ODI series. Harry Brook was the only exception, he was a part of the ODI series but after being included in the squad in place of Jason Roy, he will rest for the entire series. Root will be looking to gain some momentum before the ODI World Cup commences on October 5. He has struggled for form during England's recently concluded 3-1 series win over New Zealand, making 6, 0 and 4 in the first three games before a rusty knock of 29(40) in the fourth ODI at Lord's. His knock further exposed his lack of rhythm and consistency in the 50-over format. Overall since England's triumph in the 2019 World Cup, he has only batted 16 times in ODI format. England's national selector Luke Wright, revealed Root's ""asked to be involved"" in Wednesday's first ODI. ""Like for a lot of people, he is getting that rhythm of 50-over cricket. Obviously, we don't play [much of] it in this country, but a lot of those lads haven't played a lot of 50-over cricket, especially someone like Joe,"" Wright said as quoted from ESPNcricinfo. ""He just wanted a bit more time. It's a great thing for someone to still have that desire to keep wanting to do more and more. It shows where he's at with his game and what makes him such a world-class player that, when he doesn't feel quite right, he still wants to tinker and do more. As much as we probably thought he needed a break as well, he just wanted another go,"" Wright added. Wright went on to indicate that Roy who is suffering from back spasms could feature in the second as well as the third ODI against Ireland. ""We've given Jason the option of being involved and he still has the option,"" Wright said. ""He wasn't expected to be in that Ireland squad and then to get the news that he was missing out on the World Cup came as a bit of a hammer blow, so we've left that with Jason…. We'll work on that one over the next few days."" England will play the first ODI against Ireland on Wednesday at Headingley. England squad vs Ireland: Zak Crawley (c), Ben Duckett (vc), Rehan Ahmed, Joe Root (first ODI only), Brydon Carse, Sam Hain, Will Jacks, Craig Overton, Matthew Potts, Phil Salt, George Scrimshaw, Jamie Smith, Luke Wood.

"Pace Legend Blasts BCCI, Finds India vs Australia ODIs 'Unnecessary'","The Indian cricket team registered a comprehensive 10-wicket win against Sri Lanka in the Asia Cup final on Sunday. After Sri Lanka opted to bat, Mohammed Siraj ran through their battng order, picking six wickets for just 21 runs in seven overs. Sri Lanka were skittled out for a paltry total of 50 runs, which India chased down in 6.1 overs. Sunday's win is a good confidence booster ahead of next month's World Cup on home soil. However, before their opening game of the tournament on October 8 against Australia, India face the Pat Cummins -led side in a three-match series, starting September 22. However, former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram feels the Australia series is ""unnecessary"" as it might add to the fatigue for Indian players. ""There are different venues and traveling in India... it takes a day (between every match). You need to preserve energy before the World Cup. I don't know why they are playing three ODIs. It is probably done a long time ago, but it was a bit unnecessary. You don't want to be tired before a mega-tournament where you are favourites at home. If you want some more players in the squad, you can play those in the three ODIs against Australia,"" Akram said on Star Sports. Over the last 12 months, several Indian players have picked up injuries. The likes of Jasprit Bumrah and KL Rahul recently returned to action after overcoming lengthy set backs. Akram, however, wants the Indian team to make the most of the opportunity by resting key players. ""Out of the three games (against Australia), Bumrah should play at least two as he is coming out of injury. His rhythm is looking good, he's looking incredible but his muscles can get stronger. Suryakumar Yadav is struggling in ODIs recently, he can play all those five games (Australia series and two warm-ups). Sometimes, Virat can rest as well because it is a long World Cup. They have to play 9 games,"" he added.",sports
Video Claims Rohit Forgot Passport On Way To Airport After Final. Then...,"Sunday brought in great news for the Indian cricket team. The Rohit Sharma -led side put up clinical show to win the Asia Cup 2023 final against Sri Lanka in Colombo by 10 wickets. A fairytale spell from Mohammed Siraj skittled through the Sri Lankan batting order on Sunday in the final of the Asia Cup. The 29-year-old pacer made history, not just for himself but for the country. Siraj became the first Indian bowler to take four wickets in an over in men's internationals. He is the joint fastest to take 5 wickets in a match, but most importantly his performance helped India win the Asia cup for a record 8th time. However, after the match, a rather funny thing apparently happened with the captain of the team - Rohit Sharma. He reportedly forgot his passport in the team hotel in Colombo, as the rest of the members waited for the bus to depart for the airport to return to India. Finally, a support staff of the Indian team got the passport back for Rohit. Virat Kohli in 2017 - I haven't seen anyone forget things like Rohit Sharma does. He even forgets his iPad, passport. Tonight - Rohit forgot his passport, and a support staff member gave it back to him. (Ankan Kar). pic.twitter.com/3nFsiJwCP4 The incident reminded social media of what Virat Kohli had said on Breakfast With Champions. In an episode of the talk show, Kohli had said: ""Rohit often forgets things like ipads etc. Once or twice he has even forgot his passport. The logistical manager has now started to check whether Rohit has brought everything and only then the team bus departs"". It seems something similar might have happened on Sunday. Virat Kohli was right when he said Rohit Sharma forgets almost every thing Yesterday Rohit once again forgot his passport. pic.twitter.com/8Hyxk6Az4W After speedster Mohammed Siraj's fiery spell decimated Sri Lanka, the opening duo of Shubman Gill and Ishan Kishan scored a flawless fifty-run partnership as India won the Asia Cup for the eighth time. Leading India's fast bowling attack, Siraj ran through the Sri Lanka top-order in a dazzling performance in the summit clash at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Sunday. It took a little more than two hours for India to lift the trophy in style. Sri Lanka fans were stunned into silence by their team's performance. The Men in Blue lifted the Asia Cup trophy after five years. Siraj had a dream spell as the entire Sri Lanka team was back in pavilion in 15.2 overs for 50 runs. Siraj took six wickets in seven overs, his best performance in ODIs. Needing just 51 runs, Shubman Gill and Ishan Kishan made no mistakes and started with back-to-back boundaries off Matheesha Pathirana 's over. In the third over of the game, Gill sliced three successive boundaries off Pramod Madushan , taking India's total to 32/0. On the first delivery of 7th over, Kishan took a single and took India home with an assertive 10-wicket victory. Jasprit Bumrah set the tone of the game by making his impact on the third ball of his first over. Siraj followed it up with a maiden over to lay the perfect platform for a spell that left the entire stadium awe-struck. Advertisement On the first ball of his second over, Siraj sent back Pathum Nissanka for 2. The second ball clicked 143 kmph and Samarawickrama decided to play it safe. The third delivery, however, swung sharply back into the right-handed batter, pinned his legs right in front of the stumps and sent him back for a two-ball duck. Sri Lanka's match-winner against Pakistan, Charith Asalanka stepped in to keep Sri Lanka's innings from falling apart. Siraj baited him and lured him to play the drive shot. Asalanka took the bait and the ball went straight to Ishan Kishan at covers. With hat-trick on his mind, Siraj once again tried to go for the inswinging delivery to the newcomer Dhananjaya de Silva . A gentle push on the vacant side of the field sent the ball for a four. The pacer came back on the next delivery, found a faint edge and carried comfortably in the gloves of Rahul. Siraj completed an over in which he took four wickets, something rare in ODI cricket and more so in a title match. However, he wasn't done yet, nor was his 'Sui' celebration. He shattered the stumps completely beating skipper Dausn Shanaka and sending him for a duck. This was the first time India took six wickets in the first 10 overs in an ODI match. with ANI inputs",sports

I listened to his words, but I didn't really hear them.” “I was anxious and terrified through the shoot of the film. I couldn't shake the feeling that Vishal had never really wanted me for this part, that my casting was based more on the budget that my presence could afford than the director's belief in me.

"COVID-19: Neanderthal Genes May Explain Coronavirus Severity in Some People, Says Study","Milan, September 18: People who suffered severe Covid-19 infections are more likely to have a set of genes, inherited from Neanderthals, according to an Italian study. Italy was one of the severely affected countries during the early days of the pandemic. Researchers from the country’s Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research analysed the relationship between genetic factors and the severity of the Covid-19 disease in the province of Bergamo, the epicentre of the pandemic in the country. Their study, published in the journal iScience, shows that a certain region of the human genome was significantly associated with the risk of getting Covid-19 and becoming seriously ill in residents in those areas most affected by the pandemic. COVID-19: WHO Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus Urges China To Give 'Full Access' To Probe Origins of Coronavirus, Says Report. In the study of 1,200 people, the team found that the presence of three of the six genes of a region located on chromosome 3 makes people more susceptible to Covid severity. These are the CCR9 and CXCR6 genes, responsible for recalling white blood cells and causing inflammation during infections, and the LZTFL1 gene, which regulates the development and function of epithelial cells in the respiratory tract, conditioning the different manifestations of the disease. It's unclear which gene plays the most important role. In addition, the study identified 17 other new genomic regions (loci) of which 10 were potentially associated with severe disease and 7 were potentially associated with risk of infection, the researchers said. ""The sensational thing is that three of the six genes associated with this risk have reached the modern population from Neanderthals, in particular from the Vindija genome that dates back to 50,000 years ago and was found in Croatia,"" said Giuseppe Remuzzi, Director of the Mario Blacks Institute, in a statement. COVID-19 Effect: Impact of Coronavirus Far From Over As Families in China Still Grapple With Trauma From Previous Waves. COVID-19 Effect: Impact of Coronavirus Far From Over As Families in China Still Grapple With Trauma From Previous Waves. ""It may once have protected Neanderthals from infection, but now it causes an excess of immune response that not only does not protect us but exposes us to a more severe disease. The victims of the Neanderthal chromosome in the world are perhaps 1 million and could be precisely those who, in the absence of other causes, die from a genetic predisposition,"" he added. In 2022, a study by a team from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and Max Planck Institute in Germany showed modern humans have inherited a major genetic risk factor for severe Covid-19 from Neanderthals. It showed that CCR5 gene, located on chromosome 3 can reduce a person’s risk of contracting HIV by 27 per cent. In the latest study, the 1,200 people were divided into three homogeneous groups for characteristics and risk factors: 400 who had a severe form of the disease, 400 who contracted the virus in a mild form and 400 who did not contract it. People who had severe Covid-19 more frequently had first-degree relatives who died from the virus than participants with mild Covid-19 or who had not become infected. This finding highlights a contribution of genetics to the severity of the disease. ""The results show that those who have been exposed to the virus and are carriers of the Neanderthal haplotype had more than double the risk of developing severe Covid (pneumonia), Almost three times more risk of needing intensive care and an even greater risk of needing mechanical ventilation than subjects who do not have this haplotype,"" said Marina Noris, Head of the Human Genomics Center of the Mario Blacks Institute.

"""Pant Has Inspired Lot Of Wicket-keeper Batters Around World"": Gilchrist","Rishabh Pant isn't fit to play the upcoming World Cup but former Australian ace Adam Gilchrist is still fascinated by the kind of impact that the burly keeper-batter has had in his six years with the Indian team. Pant, who met with a horrific car accident last December, is currently doing his rehabilitation programme at the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru and is expected to make a comeback sometime next year. In his absence, KL Rahul will keep wickets for India and Ishan Kishan has a good chance of playing as a specialist middle-order batter. ""I think Rishabh has inspired a lot of wicket-keeper batters around the world to play that way (he does). It is fascinating for such a young man to have such an impact that Rishabh has had and others are responding and playing in that positive manner,"" Gilchrist, who is in India on a promotional visit, told PTI. Gilchrist was impressed how Kishan has shaped up despite knowing that Rahul will be the first keeper. ""They (India) are well stocked. They have got a couple of options there, obviously when KL was out with his injury, Ishan Kishan took his opportunity and played really well and now they find themselves in the team together so that's a wonderful case of taking an opportunity,"" said the man who won three World Cups for Australia. What Gilchrist found laudable was Kishan's ability to force the selectors to keep him in the mix with consistent performances. ""Being positive and then and forcing the selectors into keeping you in the team so it seems like KL is gonna be the one who is going to continue with the gloves but it does not seem to hinder Ishan Kishan's batting, he seems to be playing really well, carefree, attacking and dangerous,"" he explained. The man, who played nearly 400 international games across three formats, with 15,000 plus runs and over 900 dismissals (catches and stumpings), however had straight forward choices as far as four potential semi-finalists were concerned. ""I think India and Pakistan could feature in the semi-finals, Australia and England are another two teams,"" opined Gilchrist. Gilchrist is hopeful that five-time champions will do well in India, where they won a bilateral series 3-0 last time around. Advertisement ""Australia will learn a lot from their efforts in South Africa when they come to India, they have got three games before the World Cup against India so they will have a bit more of a full strength squad there so that might tell us a bit about where they are at so its a bit hard who's gonna win it (World Cup) but I think there is probably four semi-finalists there."" Adam Zampa recently was taken to cleaners by Heinrich Klaasen during an ODI in South Africa, having gone for 113 and 70 in his quota of overs. But Gilchrist has full faith in Zampa's quality and ability to bounce back. ""Adam Zampa, obviously in South Africa was at the receiving end a little bit but it's different conditions out here in India with different pitches and he is a world-class spin bowler and he has shown that particularly across T20 cricket and now he gets his chance in the 50 over World Cup,"" Gilchrist said. Australia will bank on their experienced players. ""So its a very knowledgeable group and they are going to use and they are going to have to use all that experience against batting line ups now across the globe and play without fear, so that is a challenge for all the bowlers on how to take on aggressive batting line ups."" There has been some suggestions about pushing veteran David Warner down the order but someone, who was a mega successful opener in the shorter formats, feels a move like that could well back-fire. ""He (Warner) looked really good in South Africa for the most part of what he did, I think he has got to bat at the top, there has been some sort of discussions that he bats down the middle order but I think he has got to open,"" he then gave his rationale. ""...and he (Warner) showed in South Africa a couple of times that he is aggressive and dominant at the top of the order as he has ever been so I think they bring with him a lot of experience and a lot of confidence and I think he should play at the top of the order for Australia and if he plays really well then our opposition will fear that.""

Blinken Calls For Managing China Tensions In New Top-Level Talks,"Antony Blinken said he believed in ""face-to-face diplomacy"" to deal with disagreements. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Monday for managing tensions with China ""responsibly"" as he met with the vice president in the rival powers' second high-level talks in days. Meeting Vice President Han Zheng in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, Blinken said he believed in ""face-to-face diplomacy"" to deal with disagreements. ""I think it's a good thing that we have this opportunity to build on the recent high-level engagements that our countries have had,"" Blinken told him as they opened their meeting at China's mission to the United Nations. The talks aim to ""make sure that we're maintaining open communications and demonstrate that we are responsibly managing the relationship between our two countries."" The meeting comes as the United States watches personnel changes in Beijing with growing intrigue. Qin Gang, handpicked by President Xi Jinping as foreign minister, was abruptly replaced in July by the veteran policymaker Wang Yi. US officials initially expected Wang to travel to the annual UN meeting, where he may have met briefly with President Joe Biden, but instead China said that the comparatively lesser-known Han would come. But Wang, who also is the Communist Party foreign policy director, held talks over the weekend with Biden's national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, in Malta. The United States and China remain at loggerheads on a host of issues including Taiwan, the self-ruling democracy that Beijing claims and has not ruled out seizing by force. China charges that the United States is stirring up Taiwanese independence supporters, and has repeatedly staged shows of force. The United States says it is seeking the preservation of the status quo and has stepped up support, including last month for the first time approving direct military aid to Taiwan, which traditionally buys its own weapons. China has also been outraged by US restrictions on high-end investment and exports of semiconductors from the United States, which says it is doing that to safeguard its own security. But the tone has become comparatively civil. Blinken and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen both traveled this year to Beijing, resuming contact that had all but ceased during the pandemic. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com The approach to China stands in contrast with the US refusal of most dialogue with Russia since the invasion of Ukraine, with Blinken and other senior US officials doubting the utility of talking to Moscow.

"Zelensky Meets Injured Ukraine Soldiers In US, Tells Them To ""Stay Strong""","Zelensky met a group of wounded Ukrainian soldiers at Staten Island University Hospital As he looked at the missing limbs and grief-stricken faces of wounded Ukrainian soldiers being treated in a US hospital, President Volodymyr Zelensky had one word for Russian leaders heading to a key UN summit: ""terrorists."" Zelensky arrived in New York on Monday to address the United Nations General Assembly and plead for more aid as Ukraine painfully pushes ahead with a high-stakes counteroffensive to wrest back territory from Russian forces more than 18 months into the war. Before meeting world leaders, Zelensky headed to Staten Island University Hospital, where a group of Ukrainian soldiers are receiving prosthetic arms and legs and rehabilitation services. In a large hospital room, the Ukrainian president watched as several soldiers in khaki uniform practiced walking and lifting weights with newly acquired prosthetic legs and arms. Zelensky chatted with the soldiers and shook their hands -- if they had them. Even as he tried to lift the soldiers' spirits, the Ukrainian leader was visibly shaken. ""Is it tough?"" Zelensky asked one soldier. ""A little,"" came the reply. Another soldier, who hails from the Zaporizhzhia region in southern Ukraine, the site of intense fighting, tried to put on a brave face. ""How are you doing? Is it difficult?"" Zelensky asked. The soldier paused, then answered: ""It's okay."" ""Stay strong,"" Zelensky implored. Nine Ukrainian soldiers are currently undergoing treatment at the hospital. The clinic has helped a total of 35 servicemen over the past year, according to hospital staff and the Ukrainian-American NGO Kind Deeds which supplies prostheses for war amputees. Kyiv does not disclose war casualty figures, but US officials estimate that the number of dead and wounded Ukrainian soldiers is nearing 500,000, the New York Times reported last month. ""Get home soon, thank you for your service,"" Zelensky told the soldiers as he left the room. In another room, Zelensky, flanked by medical staff, told a different group of soldiers that their American doctors were amazed by the Ukrainian servicemen's resilience and dedication. ""He said 'I've never seen people who have such a strong desire to return home,'"" Zelensky said of one physician. ""We all will be waiting for you to come back home, we absolutely need every one of you, every strong Ukrainian fighter in order to defeat our enemy. I am convinced that it will certainly happen."" Zelensky then presented some soldiers and hospital staff with Ukrainian state awards. Asked by a journalist about the possibility of ending up in the same room with Russian representatives during the General Assembly , Zelensky turned somber. ""It is, for us, very important that all our words, all our messages, are heard by our partners,"" Zelensky said. ""If in the United Nations still ... there is a place for Russian terrorists, the question is not to me -- I think it's a question to all the member states."" Zelensky posed for photos with soldiers, including one who had prosthetics for both arms and appeared deeply traumatized. After the photo was taken, Zelensky helped the soldier sit back down. Due to address the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, Zelensky headed off. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com ""I wish you victory and to come back home,"" he told the soldiers.

Kuldeep's prowess with spin was on display throughout the Asia Cup is now going to miss the first two games of India's three-match ODI series due to the risk of not exposing him a lot before the ODI World Cup. Opposition batters were at Kuldeep's mercy as he scalped 9 wickets in 5 games at an average of 11.44 and an economy of 3.61.

""Kuldeep is a rhythm bowler, we all know that. But we thought of a lot of things and took this call.

""We have been looking at Kuldeep for the last one, one and a half years, this is why we don't want to expose him a lot. He is coming back for the last match. There are a lot of reasons. This is the best decision for us, to have him sit out for two games and play the third. We also have two practice matches [before the World Cup opener], so for the bowling rhythm, he will be back in it,"" Rohit added.

""...with guys like him, it's all in the head, more than body and the stuff. We made the decision speaking to him and understanding where he is at with regards to his body and stuff like that. ""It's not like he is not playing any cricket. Yes, he hasn't played the format but he has been playing Test cricket in West Indies, and if I am not wrong, played TNPL as well and although no comparison there but there is still some cricket there, and it gives us chance to look at how he is bowling,"" he said. The selectors have rested in-form Kuldeep Yadav for the first two ODIs. Asked if that was done to keep an element of surprise in the World Cup, Rohit said, ""Kuldeep is a wrist spinner and needs rhythm but we also deliberated that his bowling form is great and as Ajit (chief selector) said we needed to give some of the players chance as they played only one match in Asia Cup and are there in WC squad and we needed to check them as well. ""Kuldeep, we have seen for last 18 months and we didn't want to expose him. He will be playing in the last match and the best decision to see him is in 3rd match. We have two practice games and he will be back in bowling rhythm,"" said the skipper. Rest given to senior players in the first two ODIs will provide opportunity for fringe players like Tilak Varma and Ruturaj Gaikwad. ""Our endeavour is to give everyone a chance. If we only play 11 through the year, then you can't create bench strength. You can see that some other teams are facing injury problems because it also involves lot of travelling and we have to play 11 matches and crisscross the country,"" Rohit said when asked about travelling involved over the course of the World Cup.

"Mumbai City 0–2 FC Nassaji Mazandaran, AFC Champions League 2023–24: Islanders Suffer Defeat in Opener As Ehsan Hosseini and Mohammad Azadi Secure Victory for Tigers","Indian Super League (ISL) League Shield winners Mumbai City FC started their AFC Champions League 2023-24 campaign on a disappointing note, going down 0-2 to Iranian club Nassaji Mazandaran FC here on Monday. Ehsan Hosseini (34th minute) and Mohammad Azadi (62nd minute) scored for the Iranian club as they quelled a strong challenge put up by the Islanders, who showcased immense attacking prowess but were unable to find the finishing touch. Cristiano Ronaldo Shares Frame With Saudi Arabian Ambassador in Iran Ahead of ACL 2023-24 Clash Against Persepolis, Picture Goes Viral! . Mumbai City started the game in typical attacking fashion and was piling on the pressure early on. The Islanders created the first chance of the game in the 3rd minute but failed as the shot was saved at the near post. Diaz’s movement in the final third was posing a lot of challenges to the Nassaji back-line. In the 9th minute, Jorge picked up the ball on the right wing and made his way to the byline, he found Chhangte with a low cross in the centre. Chhangte unleashed a devastating shot that was inches away from finding the back of the net. The Islanders were stifling the Nassaji attack superbly as Apuia Ralte and Yoel van Nieff were making sure they were winning the ball in midfield and supporting the high press led by Greg and Jorge. Nassaji were struggling to get out of their half and Phurba was relatively untroubled in the first 15 minutes of the game. The next chance of the game broke the way of the Islanders in the 19th minute. Against the run of play, Nassaji Mazandaran took the lead in the 33rd minute. A cheeky ball by Nassaji’s captain Hossein Zamehran right outside the box found Mohammad Hosseini on the left wing behind Rahul Bheke. Mohammad Hosseini’s first touch saw him break into the Islanders’ penalty box and he put the ball past Lachenpa with his second touch to make it 1-0 in favour of the Iranian club. Despite Mumbai City FC dominating possession, they were struggling to create clear-cut chances against Nassaji as they were chasing the game. In added time at the end of the first half, Mumbai City FC conjured another chance to equalise but Bipin Singh was inches wide of the mark as the Iranian club led 1-0 at the break. Mumbai City FC came out for the second half in the hope of equalising quickly. The Islanders created the first chance of the half in the 52nd minute. Chhangte was found on the right wing by a long ball, the diminutive winger then put in a dangerous ball toward Pereyra Diaz in the centre. The ball unfortunately never reached Diaz thanks to an interception by a Nassaji defender, his clearance made its way to Yoel van Nieff who unleashed a venous strike but it was off-target. Nassaji were absorbing the pressure brilliantly and launching counters. The Iranian club made some tactical changes at the start of the second half as they brought on Mherdad Abdi and Frashid Esmaeili for Hossein Zamehrani and Mohammad Hosseini. Soon after Nassaji doubled their lead in the 66th minute of the game. A scruffed clearance by Rostyn put Akash Mishra under pressure inside his own box on the left wing. Mishra was dispossessed by Frashid Esmaeili, who drove to the byline and put in a low ball towards the centre to find Mohammadreza Azadi, who put the ball past Lachenpa to make it 2-0 for Nassaji Mazandaran.

Nassaji were sitting back in their own half and looking to hit the Islanders on the counter. Mumbai City FC was throwing men forward in the hopes of cutting down the deficit. In the 71st minute of the game, the Islanders created the best chance of the game as Greg drove forward with the ball. The Scotsman took a powerful yet speculative shot from a distance that was right at the keeper and was grasped by him with ease. Des Buckingham made the right substitutions to strengthen the attack. They created many chances but continued to squander chances. (The above story first appeared on LatestLY on Sep 19, 2023 08:35 AM IST.

"Malayalam film ‘Rani’, releasing on September 21, is an investigative thriller, says its director Shankar Ramakrishnan","The murder of a political heavyweight unleashes an investigation that explores several facets of the man, as seen through the people close to him. His wife, sister, mistress, confidante and others close to him peel the layers of the man called Dharmarajan, alias Selvan, a local legislator. Rani , actor-director-scenarist Shankar Ramakrishnan’s sophomore film, zooms into the investigation of the murder that lays bare the life of the man and the politician. “ Rani is an investigative thriller that unfolds the story of Dharmarajan, enacted by Guru Somasundaram , a wily and hard politician, with a finger in many pies in the region. The investigation headed by Raju chettan ’s [Maniyanpillai Raju] character, Deputy Superintendent Raghu, is assisted by circle inspector Soman, essayed by Krishnan Balakrishnan,” says Shankar. He adds that women are the real stars in the narrative. “His wife, his sibling, his sultry concubine and keeper of secrets, an iron-willed head nurse, a docile domestic worker and an idealist-activist teacher drive the story forward.” Written and directed by Shankar, Rani has an interesting multi-star cast that brings together actors such as Maniyanpillai Raju, Urvashi, Guru Somasundaram, Indrans, Maala Parvathy, Anumol, Krishnan Balakrishnan, Honey Rose, Ashwin Gopinath and Aswath Lal among others. Urvashi is Sheela, Dharmarajan’s sister and an author; Maala Parvathy appears as Maheshwari, the politician’s concubine; Anumol enacts Sona, the rich daughter of a wealthy liquor contractor. Niyathi Kadambi makes her debut in Malayalam cinema through this film. Niyathi plays Rani, a domestic worker who works in several houses. Helpless and economically insecure, she becomes an easy suspect in the murder. “But then the people in the three houses where she works turn out to be the surprise as they rally around to support her. I believe there is a Rani in every woman; a strength that comes to the fore when she is pushed to the corner. She is Nature herself, the irrepressible force of nature that cannot be vanquished. This film celebrates her strength,” says Shankar. The writer elaborates that he has always been intrigued by domestic workers who work in several houses. Their employers’ information about them is sketchy. Usually they do not have much information about their lives, families and addresses. “But these workers are privy to a lot of information about the homes they work in. They know the routine in the house and are often aware of family secrets, conversations and minute details about their employers. It is a dichotomy that has intrigued me.” He maintains that all the characters in the film, have stories to back them up and the two-hour narrative has enough space for those stories. Bhavana essays an idealistic teacher, who is pulled into a web of conspiracies when she comes up with a project to upgrade wastelands, where quarrying once flourished. “These wastelands found all around quarries, often turn into haunts of anti-socials backed by powerful lobbies who want those spaces to stay that way. Bhavana’s character comes up against such a lobby,” narrates Shankar. He believes Indrans ’ character, Bhasi, lends the story a different angle. During the writer-director’s conversations with police officers, he found that certain policemen with an innate intuition have given breakthroughs to investigating teams. “Bhasi is one such character. An elderly policeman, he has seen life at close quarters and has an intuition that comes to his rescue when it comes to interrogations. I feel Bhasi is someone who can be developed into a character for sequels as well,” says the director, a voracious reader of works by Agatha Christie, Grisham and Stieg Larsson. Shankar was planning a big-budget project, Ayyappan , helmed by Santhosh Sivan when the pandemic struck. The film had to be postponed. In the meantime, Shankar began writing a small film, the canvas of which grew bigger as the writing progressed. “That is Rani ,” says Shankar, with a smile. Shot in southern Thiruvananthapuram and parts of Kanyakumari district in Tamil Nadu, once a part of Travancore, the film is set in the hilly tracts of the region, where a number of quarries used to operate. Although the movie was shot within 22 days, time was lavished on the post-production work. “Many of these scenic and pristine locales are under-utilised and it is also budget-friendly. I am trying to bring shooting of films back to the city where it all began many years ago,” adds Shankar. As with his debut feature film, Pathinettam Padi , Shankar has invested in debutants in Rani as well. Newcomer Vinayak Gopal is the cinematographer while the songs have been composed and scored by Mena Melath. Shankar is producing the film with Vinod Menon and Jimmy Jacob under the banner of Magictail Works Production.",entertainment
"Richard Linklater’s ‘Hit Man’, with Glen Powell, sells to Netflix for USD 20M","The Toronto International Film Festival may be over but it’s biggest sale has just gone through. Netflix has acquired Richard Linklater’s Hit Man , starring Glen Powell, for USD 20 million. Hit Man , which Linklater and Powell co-wrote, stars the Top Gun: Maverick actor as a New Orleans psychology professor who also works undercover posing as a hit man for the police in sting operations to catch would-be murders.

In an interview in Toronto, Linklater, the veteran independent filmmaker of Boyhood said he and Powell elected to make the film before selling it to a distributor to avoid some of the pitfalls of modern Hollywood.

‘Wilderness’ review: A nightmare trip through a roaring rampage of plot holes,"Liv (Jenna Coleman) and Will (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) have everything — they are young, good looking and in love. Soon after their wedding, they move from Wales to New York for Will’s work, which seems to be something to do with events. The company puts them up in a fancy flat and they are quite living the dream. For their first Christmas, Liv wants everything to be perfect as she tells her mum, Caryl (Claire Rushbrook). Liv has a difficult relationship with Caryl and has problems with trust after her father left her mum for another woman. That her mother holds her (Liv) responsible for her father’s desertion complicates matters. When Liv discovers Will having an affair with his co-worker, Cara (Ashley Benson), hell hath no fury and all that. Will gives the usual excuses—it was a one-off, it did not mean anything and convinces Liv to go on a trip to America’s national parks to repair the marriage. The beautiful vistas contrast with Liv’s black thoughts as she plans the ultimate revenge on her low-life husband. There are twists and turns aplenty in this adaptation of B.E. Jones’ eponymous novel. On the acting front, Coleman nails Liv’s unreliable narrator perfectly as does Jackson-Cohen with Will’s charming, but essential love-rat persona. The characters are written with broad strokes, which could be because we are seeing them from Liv’s perspective and obviously she does not consider them very important in her scheme of things. Ash (Morgana Van Peebles) is Liv’s token gay friend, Bonnie (Talia Balsam), Will’s tough-talking boss, and Garth (Eric Balfour), Cara’s hopelessly besotted partner. The phenomenally trusting police officers, Rawlings (Marsha Stephanie Blake) and Wiseman (Jonathan Keltz) swallow all the secrets and lies like lambs. The six episodes zip by smoothly and would just as easily slip right out of your head, though the loud pop song needle drops with the exception of Swift’s ‘Look What You Made Me Do’ in the title sequence, might come in the way of that.

Mamta Mohandas on her hunger to perform and why actors need to stay grounded,"In the 18 years that she has been in the industry, actor-singer Mamta Mohandas has had many gaps; “a consistent wave,” as she puts it. The actor has done close to 50 films in Malayalam, several in Tamil and Telugu, and continues to be a much sought-after professional. And in all these years, through all those gaps, cinema and music have been constant; they have also played more roles than one might think as evident when she looks back from the time she grew up in Bahrain. Those days, in Bahrain, Mamta’s portal to cinema was through music. She recalls how it was either by renting out VHS tapes of films — one fond memory is falling in love with Alaipayuthey for its music and never returning the tape — or through the only television channel, Channel 55, that had Indian content. “There is something special about understanding ‘my land, my nation’ through cinema. Wanting to be more Indian was so inbred because what you are kept away from is what you desire the most,” Mamta says. Though the film lover in her would have wished her good luck, Mamta entered the film industry reluctantly. “I was a reluctant actor because I wasn’t even an actor. There was no part of me that was about presenting myself; I was nervous, I had body image issues, and a lot of inhibitions that made me shy and unconfident.” It isn’t the process of making a film that made her feel so; in fact, that’s the part she enjoys the most, she says. “Being an actor is also about how you put yourself out there, say, during promotions, and that was difficult to embrace.” The flip side of these gaps in Mamta’s career, due to her battle with Hodgkin lymphoma and the subsequent changes, she says, might have inadvertently prolonged her cinema career. “I was able to stay more informed and re-informed. For instance, every time I went away and came back, something about cinema would have changed, like the way we present characters or do visual drama. Had I been consistently present in the industry, I would have been out already.” She sees another silver lining from the time she moved to Los Angeles in 2014 for treatment — “an unexpected happiness that brims your heart when you have nothing, no expectations, and no certainty about the future. That happiness was something I never thought could exist because I didn’t know if I would make it past the first three months. I renewed myself in that space and I learnt my biggest life lesson during that beautiful phase.” This experience made her, she adds, confident as an individual and gave her a never-satiating hunger to perform as an actor. “Now I have an extreme hunger to fully understand the entire film and how the director is thinking and seeing my character.” This is why Mamta urges young actors to not lose sight of their human side. “An actor has to touch the ground and experience things,” she says. Mamta prefers the director first narrate the story and not just her character outline; perhaps how you might see her in a film like Jana Gana Mana , where though she has very limited screen time, the character creates enough impact for a whole film. “ Jana Gana Mana was told to me in just 30 minutes but something about the way it was conveyed to me made me fall in love with it.” Her upcoming Tamil film, Maharaja , co-starring Vijay Sethupathi , is also one such film. “Producer Sudhan Sundaram’s (of Passion Studios) brief about my character was short but he told me that a layer of this character could be felt throughout the film.” No, Mamta assures you that she isn’t dying in this film, unlike in Jana Gana Mana or her previous Tamil appearance, Enemy . “I think people like to kill me on screen, it’s as if they think ‘she didn’t die in real life so let’s kill her on screen’ ( laughs ).” In Maharaja , a revenge saga, Mamta plays the single female lead and the actor says that the drama has a well-written protagonist and antagonist. “There are several beautiful characters who influence the decisions and emotions of the protagonist and move him in ways even he would not have experienced — that makes its storytelling powerful.” But more than the character and the story, what really made her agree to do Maharaja was that it’s a Vijay Sethupathi film, in fact, his 50th. “I just love him. Sethu sir is a serious actor. In fact, more than an actor, he’s an artist. That’s very rare to come across in the industry. According to me, India has three artists in cinema: Mohanlal sir, Kamal Haasan sir, and Vijay Sethupathi sir.” Mamta reminisces about the time she met Vijay Sethupathi for the first time at an award function. “He was then shooting for Super Deluxe (in which he plays a transwoman) and I could see that he was still in character! Even when he went on stage, I observed that he had greatly shifted from the masculine form that he was in. That’s the kind of inspiration you need to keep going in this industry.” The first Vijay Sethupathi film that Mamta watched was Naduvula Konjam Pakkatha Kaanom , a film in a genre she loves. “I love such ‘timepass comedies with loose-laughs’. Even among my own films, My Boss and Two Countries stand out in that aspect.” Mamta loves to see the comedy out of the serious, as evident as it is from the sarcastic quip she made about why filmmakers kill her on screen. So, why isn’t she doing more comedies? “I would love to. In India, we have always taken ourselves too seriously but now, we have realised that it’s okay to make jokes about our culture and tradition because nothing has gone as per our plans. I do want to do more comedies but the timing and chemistry with your co-artist should also work.” She agrees that this is a cue for Tamil directors as most of her Tamil films have been serious, like Thadaiyara Thaakka , Enemy , and Maharaja . Mamta is also waiting to don a new hat: as a producer. In 2020, she started Mamta Mohandas Productions and even released a single. However, the banner hasn’t made a film yet. “We released a single and we still have some ideas for music. But the production banner has been put on hold because I have been doing films back-to-back in Malayalam post the pandemic.” Apart from Maharaja , she also has Otta , the directorial debut of Academy Award-winning sound designer Resul Pookutty, in which she says she has a ‘friendly’ appearance. She signs off by revealing that Tamil audiences might soon see her in a full-fledged role, details of which are currently awaited.",entertainment
India-Canada Row: Experts Say Diplomatic Tensions Unlikely To Impact Trade Ties,"The diplomatic tensions are unlikely to impact trade relations between India and Canada, as economic ties are driven by commercial considerations, experts said. The current flare-up in geopolitical relationships began as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused the Indian government of having possible links with the killing of a Khalistani separatist leader in June. The North American country asked an Indian official to leave that country. In retaliation, India also expelled one of the Canadian diplomats. Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) Co-Founder Ajay Srivastava told news agency PTI that recent events are unlikely to affect the deep-rooted people-to-people connections, trade, and economic ties between the two nations. Both countries, according to Srivastava, don't compete on similar product sections. ""Hence, the trade relationship will continue to grow and not be affected by day-to-day events,"" Srivastava said. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); According to Sharad Kumar Saraf, Chairman of Mumbai-based Technocraft Industries, ""The bilateral trade is entirely driven by commercial considerations.

""In fact, bilateral trade is an effective tool to improve political relations. India must make special efforts to increase our bilateral trade with Canada,"" Saraf said. Notably, India and Canada put a hold on the free trade agreement negotiations ahead of the G20 leaders summit, according to a senior official.

On the other hand, Canada's exports to India, valued at $4.06 billion, include commodities like pulses, timber, pulp and paper, as well as mining products. Additionally, Canadian pension funds have expressed their commitment to continue investing in India due to the country's vast market potential and attractive returns on investment, the report said. As of the end of 2022, Canadian pension funds injected over $45 billion into India, making it the fourth-largest recipient of Canadian Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) globally. Key sectors attracting Canadian pension fund investments in India encompass infrastructure, renewable energy, technology, and financial services. India and Canada also share a growing educational partnership, with more than 200 collaborative initiatives between Indian and Canadian educational institutions, as per the report.

BP names Kate Thomson as interim CFO in post-Looney reshuffle,"BP names Kate Thomson as interim CFO in post-Looney reshuffle BP on Tuesday appointed Kate Thomson as interim chief financial officer to take the place of Murray Auchincloss who became interim CEO last week. The reshuffle follows the abrupt departure of CEO Bernard Looney last week after he did not fully disclose past relationships with colleagues. Thomson, who joined BP nearly 20 years ago, previously headed the finances of the energy giant's oil and gas production and operations division. She has been a member of the board of Aker BP (AKRBP.OL) for the past seven years and also serves on the boards of a number of BP group companies. Looney's departure sparked an urgent search internally and externally for a new, permanent CEO, with no clear front-runner. ""Kate's experience and skills make her ideally suited to take on the role of interim CFO. She brings deep technical knowledge together with a detailed understanding of BP,"" Auchincloss said in a statement. Auchincloss, 52, worked closely with Looney in devising BP's energy transition strategy and has advocated a focus on high-return assets to finance the transition, according to two company sources.

China#39;s Huawei set to re-enter mid-range 5G phone market,"China's Huawei set to re-enter mid-range 5G phone market Huawei may launch a mid-range 5G phone as soon as October, China's IT Times reported on Tuesday, in what would be another sign the technology giant has overcome U.S. sanctions. From 2019, the U.S. has restricted Huawei's access to chipmaking tools essential for producing the most advanced handset models, with the company only able to launch limited batches of 5G models using stockpiled chips. Huawei may launch a 5G version of its mid-ranged Nova around October or November, the IT Times said, citing industrial supply chain sources. Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report in the IT Times, which is owned by the Shanghai arm of state-owned China Telecom. Last month, Huawei rolled out the Mate 60 Pro smartphone with little advertising or prior notice. Research firms say they have found that it is powered by a domestically-made 7-nanometer processor and is 5G capable, which would mark a breakthrough in China's efforts to build its domestic chip ecosystem. Huawei's last Nova model is constrained to 4G and retails for around 2,400 yuan($329)domestically, while the Mate 60 Pro, released in limited numbers so far, retails for 6,999 yuan.

Ganesh on playing a cricketer in ‘Baanadariyalli’ and reuniting with Preetham Gubbi for a love story,"Outside the boundary rope at the Aditya Global cricket stadium in Nelamangala, Bengaluru, actor Ganesh, sporting a cricketer’s avatar, talks to me about his love for the gentleman’s game. “There’s a reason why most people aspire to be cricketers or actors in our country,” he says. “I have loved cricket ever since I was a child. I play cricket when I take breaks from films. I meet my friends from the film fraternity to play friendly matches once a month. I never miss playing in the Celebrity Cricket League (CCL) and the Karnataka Chalanachitra Cup (KCC),” adds Ganesh, fondly called the ‘Golden Star’ of Kannada cinema. In Baanadariyalli, Ganesh’s upcoming film with his best friend and filmmaker Preetham Gubbi, the actor plays the role of a cricketer. In one of the scenes from the trailer, he plays a reverse sweep, and his answer when asked about it is surely intriguing. “I play a struggling cricketer who is also short-tempered in the film. Whenever he gets angry, he does something quirky or bizarre. The reverse sweep is not a traditional shot. You play it out of haste or desperation sometimes. It is a metaphor for his character. The film is about how the guy who plays reverse sweeps starts hitting straight shots. In this sense, the film is a tale of his transformation,” explains Ganesh. The film, Ganesh’s fourth collaboration with Gubbi after Maleyali Jotheyali, Dil Rangeela, and 99 (a remake of the Tamil hit 96 ) , is essentially a love story at heart. Like the actor-director’s previous films, Baanidariyalli too sees the protagonist travel to a specific destination to fall in love; if it was Sakleshpura in Maleyali Jotheyali and Goa in Dil Rangeela, the hero in Baanadariyalli goes to Maasai Mara, the National Reserve in Kenya. “The reason why the protagonist travels in this film is very different compared to what we saw in Maleyali Jotheyali and Dil Rangeela ,“ points out Ganesh. “Also, Baanadariyalli has more depth than the other two films. If I have to say it in one word, the film is an experience. If you have noticed, our trailer begins like a film, and then you get a feel of watching a documentary. It ends on an emotional note. The film is a blend of cinema and documentary, and I am sure people will know we have tried something different.” Shooting in a National Reserve was challenging, says the actor. “Maasai Mara is a tourist spot, so there were a lot of rules for us to follow while shooting. We had to pay and get permission at several spots and the film’s budget kept increasing.” ALSO READ: ‘Sapta Sagaradaache Ello (Side A)’ movie review: Rakshit Shetty, Rukmini Vasanth anchor a haunting love story The actor’s career, which rose to prominence with the massive success of Mungaru Male (2006) , has blown hot and cold in over 15 years.

'Can't Say We're Favourites': Kapil Dev's Honest Take On India Ahead Of WC,"Legendary Indian all-rounder and World Cup-winning skipper Kapil Dev on Monday was all praise for the Indian team and especially pacer Mohammed Siraj, who absolutely decimated Sri Lanka to help India win the eighth Asia Cup title. After speedster Mohammed Siraj's fiery spell decimated Sri Lanka, the opening duo of Shubman Gill and Ishan Kishan's flawless fifty-run partnership ensured India won Asia Cup by ten wickets. ""Do you think I need to say anything more than what people are saying. What a fantastic cricket being played. I think as a cricketer I would like to see much closer games towards the World Cup but I think as a player dismiss them for 30 runs and win. But as a spectator, I would say it would be better if the game is close,"" Kapil Dev said at a media event. Siraj took 6/21 in seven overs to bundle out Lankan Lions for 50 runs in just 15.2 overs. Kapil Dev said he has been wonderful. “I am so happy that in the sub-continent all 10 wickets are being taken by our fast bowlers. I think that it is the cherry on the cake. There was a time when we used to depend on spinners but it is not anymore. That is why the team has become so good."" The former skipper said it is more important right now to make sure that India first qualifies for the semi-final of the ICC Cricket World Cup at home from October 5. ""I think if we come in the top 4, that is more important. You cannot say, right now, we are favourites. Our team is very good. We have to work very hard. I know about my team. I do not know about other teams...Indian team is ready to play and win the Championship. More than India winning the World Cup I want them to come out (to) dominate. I think that is what we look for in the future. I think the Indian team as far as I am concerned, are ready to play and win the World Cup,"" he said. Kapil Dev said that ahead of the World Cup, it is important to stay away from injuries and keep players safe. ""Everyone needs to be careful of injuries. Any team is badly affected if two of its players get injured. This is the reason why a stroke of luck is required. If your main player is injured then the entire team falls apart,"" he said. Answering a query related to Hardik Pandya, a pace-bowling all-rounder, he said, “Let us not talk about individuals. It is a team game”. Asked about possible inclusion of players like Shikhar Dhawan and Ravichandran Ashwin, Kapil Dev said that selectors have a better understanding of the team. Advertisement ""No need to talk about those who aren't there.

"""Trying To Make A Comeback,"": India Pacer After Long Injury Break","India seamer Deepak Chahar believes injuries are not in the hands of a sportsperson but he is determined to get his place back in the national team, having fully recovered from hamstring and back issues. The 31-year-old, who last played for India in December last year, has been bogged down by multiple injury concerns in the past. Chahar picked up a hamstring injury earlier in the season and missed as many as six IPL league games for Chennai Super Kings. Chahar had missed the whole of 2022 IPL due to a back injury and also sat out of the T20 World Cup in Australia. ""A player should not get disappointed by injuries. These things are not in a player's hand. My priority right now is to remain fit and be available for the team. I will give my 100 per cent for the team whenever I get a chance,"" Chahar told PTI Bhasha on the sidelines of a promotional event of his brand 'D9' here on Tuesday. ""In my case it can also be said that I was having a bad time. Last year I suffered a back injury, which is serious for a fast bowler but now I am completely fit. I am very happy with my bowling at the moment. ""I am trying to make a comeback into the national team. I recently played the RPL (Rajasthan Premier League) tournament. Till Sunday, I was at the National Cricket Academy. I was practising with the Indian team, which is going to China for the Asian Games,"" he added. With the ball in hand, Chahar has picked up 16 and 29 wickets respectively from 13 ODIs and 24 T20 Internationals. But Chahar is also no mean with the bat and has two half-centuries in ODIs. Chahar is not part of the Indian team for the upcoming ODI World Cup at home but the cricketer aspires to win the elite ICC tournament once during his playing career. ""A cricketer's dream is to play the World Cup and win it for the country. I will try to complete it whenever I get a chance. ""I have won many tournaments in my first appearance. It was my first Asia Cup when India won it in 2018. I have played five finals in last six IPL seasons and have become champions thrice,"" he said. ""I have not played the World Cup yet and whenever I get a chance, I want to contribute to the team's victory."" Chahar said he has learnt a lot from Mahendra Singh Dhoni, his skipper at Chennai Super Kings. ""I am very lucky that I got a chance to spend time with Mahi bhai (Dhoni). I have been playing with him for many years. I consider him as my elder brother and my idol. I respect him a lot as a player and human being. I have learnt a lot from him.""

"Smriti Mandhana, Harmanpreet Kaur Climb Spot In ICC Women's ODI Rankings","Indian batters Smriti Mandhana and Harmanpreet Kaur have jumped one spot up in the latest update of the Women's Player Rankings on Tuesday. Mandhana has climbed to fourth position with 708 points while the Indian captain Harmanpreet has improved her position to sixth with 694 points. England's star batter Nat Sciver-Brunt is the leading ODI batter in the latest updated rankings. Sciver-Brunt scored a record-breaking century in their third ICC Women's Championship ODI victory over Sri Lanka, reaching three figures in just 66 balls, the best for an England women's player. She finished with 120 from just 74 balls, hitting 18 fours and a six in the knock. More records are in the all-rounder's crosshairs after the effort, with her 807-point rating the third-highest for an English women's player in ODI batting ranking history. Only Claire Taylor (814) and Sarah Taylor (812), who reached their respective ratings in July 2009, stand above the 31-year-old. On the Sri Lankan side, Hasini Perera moved up 26 spots to 57th (325) after three innings in the series. While there was only one shuffle in the top ten rankings on the bowling side (Ayabonga Khaka going to seventh and leap-frogging Kate Cross), there were marked changes for those ready to pounce in the top 20. Charlie Dean's 5/31 in the third ODI against Sri Lanka moved her to a career-best 12th on the list (571 points), while Nida Dar (up two spots to 19th) and Nashra Sandhu (up one spot to 15th) lead the way for Pakistan. Compatriot Sadia Iqbal also made an impression, jumping 13 spots into the top 50 with successive hauls of 2-32 and 2-26 against South Africa. England's Sarah Glenn stepped up in the absence of the injured and top-ranked Sophie Ecclestone, claiming five wickets in the ODI series against Sri Lanka to move up 12 places to 52nd (328) Whilst her batting stole the limelight, it wasn't all good news in the latest update for Sciver-Brunt, who relinquished her top spot on the ODI all-rounder rankings and dropped down to third. Ash Gardner (389) moved to the top spot after Sciver-Brunt's drop, with Hayley Matthews (382) also climbing above the England mainstay after the changes. Chamari Athapaththu moves closer towards the top ten with a strong performance in England while there were a number of strong movers in minor positions. Charlie Dean (up three to equal 15th) and Salma Khatun (up two spots to equal 17th) are the next players to make challenges higher up, with Nadine de Klerk (up six spots to equal 38th) also making her mark.

From the charismatic screen presence of Shah Rukh Khan to high-octane action sequences and chartbuster music, Jawan has ticked all the boxes. One of the much-talked elements of the Atlee directorial was the many avatars of Shah Rukh Khan. Be it the bald look or the bandage get-up, SRK has nailed each avatar with utmost perfection.

Well, the Internet has yet another story behind Shah Rukh Khan's fancy mask. According to The Paperclip, a digital media house, masks were a “statement of defiance against the rigid social hierarchy” that dominated the Venetian Republic.

"""Slightly Older..."": WC-Winning Captain's Interesting Verdict On R Ashwin","After successfully winning the Asia Cup, Team India's next assignment is the three-match ODIs against Australia, which will kick-start from Friday. On Monday, skipper Rohit Sharma and BCCI chief selector Ajit Agarkar announced the squad for the upcoming series. All-rounder Ravichandran has earned a surprise call-up as he will be playing his first ODI since January, 2022. Ashwin, who is India's highest Test wicket-taker among active cricketers, has been named in the place of an injured Axar Patel and will aim to make the most from the given opportunity. The last date to submit the final squad for the ODI World Cup 2023 in September 28 and Ashwin's place in the team for the marquee event is still uncertain. However, former Sri Lanka captain Arjun Ranatunga, who led the team to a World Cup win in 1996, stated that the inclusion of Ashwin in the team will strengthen India's spin-attack and will be a huge support for Kuldeep Yadav in many matches. ""I don't know whether India has two proper spinners. They have good all-rounders, who happen to be spinners but I can't see a proper spinner in this side. On Indian pitches, they need a strong group of spinners. If not, it would be a disadvantage for India. Of course, there is Kuldeep Yadav, he can be a match-winner as he showed against Pakistan and Sri Lanka in the Asia Cup,"" Ranatunga told Indian Express. ""He is pretty clever from what I see, especially when it comes to using the variations. But you need one more to support him who could contain and attack because teams will try to target him and unsettle. Especially when you play against England, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, sometimes you might have to play 3 spinners without affecting the balance of the team. And India doesn't have a batsman who can bowl. Jadeja who bowls, bats at No 7,"" he added. Ranatunga further said that in order to be ""firm favourites"", Team India need to have a ""balanced"" all-round attack. ""You take Pakistan and England, they have proper spinners. So that is something I'm sure India will address before the World Cup. They are looking more at the all-rounders like Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel, but I personally feel that they should have someone like R Ashwin in the squad, if not in the XI. When he plays, he can be a match-winner for you,"" he said. ""He may be slightly older, he might be slightly slow on the field, but you need guys in the sub-continent who can contain and can take wickets. Sides that want to win most of the games, they do so by taking wickets and for that you need to have a balanced all-round attack. If someone like Anil Kumble is in that side then I will tag them as firm favourites, but they have a problem to address with their spinners,"" he added. The ODI series against Australia is the final dress rehearsal for hosts India before the 2023 Cricket World Cup, starting on October 5.",sports

Pakistan Begging Money from the World While India Reached the Moon: Nawaz Sharif,"Pakistan’s self-exiled former prime minister Nawaz Sharif has said that his country is begging money from the world while India has reached the moon and hosted the G20 summit, blaming the country’s former generals and judges for its economic woes. Pakistan’s economy has been in a free fall mode for the last many years, bringing untold pressure on the poor masses in the form of unchecked double-digit inflation. “Today Pakistan’s prime minister goes country to country to beg for funds while India has reached the moon and is holding G20 meetings. Why Pakistan couldn’t achieve the feats India did. Who is responsible for this here?"" Sharif asked while addressing a party meeting in Lahore from London via video link on Monday evening. The 73-year-old supreme leader of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party further said that India had followed the economic reforms initiated by his government in 1990. “When Atal Bihari Vajpayee became the prime minister of India, it had only a billion dollars in kitty but now India’s foreign exchange reserves have risen up to $600 billion,"" he said and questioned where India has reached today and where Pakistan is left behind begging the world for some bucks. In July, the IMF transferred USD 1.2 billion to cash-strapped Pakistan, part of the USD 3 billion bailout programme for nine months to support the government’s efforts to stabilise the country’s ailing economy. Sharif has for the first time announced his return to the country on October 21 to lead the party’s political campaign in the upcoming elections, ending his over four years of self-imposed exile in the UK. In November 2019, Sharif, serving a seven-year jail term in AlAzizia Mills corruption case, was helped by the then army chief Gen Bajwa to leave the country on medical grounds. The PML-N says it will secure a protective bail for him before his arrival to Lahore next month. His party has planned a historic welcome on his return. Sharif lashed out at the military and judicial establishment of 2017 whom he termed responsible for sending him home from the office of the prime minister. “The man (Nawaz) who rid the country of power load shedding was sent home by four judges,"" Sharif said in his emotional speech. He added that then-army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa and then Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief General Faiz Hamid were behind his ouster. “(Former) chief justices Saqib Nisar and Asif Saeed Khosa were tools of [the former army chief and his spy chief]. Their crime is bigger than a murder offence. Giving them pardons will be an injustice to the nation. They don’t deserve pardon,” Sharif said, vowing to hold them accountable. “These ‘characters’ who unleashed economic misery on the people of Pakistan will have to face accountability,” he pledged. Sharif also declared that his party will win in upcoming general elections. Since some former aides to Sharif’s PML-N have been appointed to the caretaker federal cabinet, and the party (PMLN) is not joining the demand to hold elections within 90 days after the dissolution of the assemblies, the Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) of Bilawal Bhutto Zardari suspects the Sharifs of cosying up to the powerful military establishment.

In a live-streamed interaction with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the X owner floated the idea that the social network may no longer be a free site, in a bid to deal with the problem of bots on the platform. “It’s the only way I can think of to combat vast armies of bots,” Musk said late on Monday. “Because a bot costs a fraction of a penny—call it a tenth of a penny—but even if it has to pay a few dollars or something, the effective cost of bots is very high,” the billionaire added. The idea of charging everyone on X is not a new idea as last year, Musk had floated it for the first time. The company currently charges $8 per month from its X Premium users, that gives them an ability to edit posts, see less ads, write longer posts and prioritised rankings in search and conversations. During the interaction, Musk said that X now now 550 million monthly users, generating 100-200 million posts every day. Musk did not disclose how many paid subscribers it currently has. During its last public earnings in Q1 2022, Twitter had mentioned 229 million mDAUs (monetizable daily active user). #Elon Musk #Social Media",technology
Fossil Fuel Treaty Necessary For 'Just And Socially Equitable' Clean Energy Transition: Experts On How To Achieve Net Zero By 2050,"Net Zero By 2050: In the G20 New Delhi Leaders' Declaration signed on September 9, 2023, world leaders have pledged to achieve global net zero greenhouse gas emissions, or carbon neutrality, by mid-century, which is 2050. As part of the Green Development Pact for a Sustainable Future, the leaders have promised to achieve carbon neutrality while keeping in mind the latest scientific developments and national circumstances. They also intend to adopt approaches such as a circular carbon economy. The declaration has also emphasised the importance of a policy for sustainable and climate finance that consists of fiscal, market and regulatory mechanisms, and also carbon pricing. Together, these mechanisms can help the world become carbon neutral or achieve a net zero economy. Carbon pricing places a fee on emitting greenhouse gases, and offers an incentive for emitting less, in order to curb greenhouse gas emissions. In order to reach net zero emissions by 2050, there is a need for US $5.8 to $5.9 trillion before 2030 for developing countries. This amount will help the countries implement their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which are climate action plans signed by all the Parties to the Paris Agreement to cut emissions and adapt to climate impacts. In order to ensure there are sufficient clean energy technologies by 2030 to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, US $4 trillion per year will be required. MUST READ | G20 Summit 2023: How The Green Development Pact Promises To Address Climate Change Challenges googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); The need for a Fossil Fuel Treaty to achieve a “just” clean energy transition Wealthy nations have more resources than vulnerable and developing countries, and hence, it is their responsibility to implement measures and take action to achieve global net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Rich countries must achieve this target ""more quickly"" than other nations, Harjeet Singh, Head of Global Political Strategy, Climate Action Network International (CAN-I), a global network in over 130 countries working to combat the climate crisis, told ABP Live. He explained that achieving ""global net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 is an urgent necessity to avert climate catastrophe"". Singh also proposed the idea of a new global mechanism — a Fossil Fuel Treaty. He said that this framework will support developing countries in transitioning away from fossil fuel dependency. “ Success requires coordinated action from all sectors of society: governments, businesses, communities, and individuals alike. While we reinforce existing agreements like the Paris Accord with stricter emissions targets, we must also introduce a new global mechanism — a Fossil Fuel Treaty. This framework should support developing countries as they transition away from dependency on fossil fuels for energy, revenue, and employment, without undermining their economic stability. At the same time, it should compel richer nations to enact bold, domestic changes. Now is the time for a comprehensive, international strategy that ensures a just transition away from fossil fuels for all.” Explaining that a Fossil Fuel Treaty is necessary for a just and socially equitable clean energy transition, Singh said that strong regulatory frameworks, financial incentives, and support from the international community will act as catalysts in the world's journey towards achieving net zero.

Materials transition, which refers to the process of designing better materials to build products such that emissions are reduced not only during manufacturing, but also while using, disposing or reusing the products, is key to achieving a net-zero future. “The materials transition is not facing ESG (Environment, Social, Governance) bottlenecks, but rather Employment, Finances, and Greed, or 'EFG' bottlenecks that need to be addressed if the G20 nations are going to resolve conflicts,” said Rajat Verma, Founder & CEO of LOHUM, a lithium-ion battery recycling company. MUST READ | Science For Everyone: What Are UFOs? Know Interesting Anecdotes, And How NASA Aims To Track Them How battery regulation laws will ensure a sustainable future Verma explained that achieving net zero by mid-century will be possible if the G20 facilitates low-cost producers that can reliably supply secondary raw materials. There must be a skilled green workforce, environmentally-conscious products must be used, and a regulatory framework to help low-cost producers thrive must be established, he suggested. ""Some of the key policy developments introduced by the G20 Nations to accelerate net zero objectives include the European Battery Regulation 2023 and India's Battery Waste Management Rules 2022. These policies provide a comprehensive regulatory foundation for sustainable, circular, and carbon neutral ecosystems,"" said Verma. MUST READ | Secured Sharing Of Climate Data, Better Drug Traceability — What Blockchain, Web3 Can Do For Climate Science, Healthcare Europe's Battery Regulation Law will ensure that batteries built in Europe are collected, reused and recycled, have a low carbon footprint, and use minimal harmful substances in order to support a transition to a circular economy, enhance the strategic autonomy of the European Union, and increase the security of raw materials supply and energy. India's Battery Waste Management Rules 2022 is based on the concept of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), where the producers and importers of batteries are responsible for the collection and recycling of waste batteries, and the use of recovered materials from wastes into new batteries. EPR also prohibits the disposal of waste batteries in landfills and incineration. The rules were published on August 24, 2022, by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. A circular economy is a model of production and consumption in which the life cycle of products is increased, and waste is reduced to a minimum through the sharing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing, and recycling of existing materials as long as possible. MUST READ | Global Group Signs Open Letter Calling For World Leaders To Agree At COP28 To Triple Renewable Energy Capacity By 2030 The role of carbon pricing in the journey towards a net-zero future Another mechanism that will play a crucial role in helping the world achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 is carbon pricing. This is because by assigning a cost to each ton of emitted carbon dioxide, carbon pricing sends a powerful market signal that incentivises businesses and encourages them to adopt greener alternatives, said Singh. “ While mechanisms like a carbon tax or cap-and-trade can make polluting expensive and drive innovation in clean technologies, these alone cannot replace the need for regulating and penalising polluting corporations.” Singh explained that the focus must be on reducing emissions effectively while also generating revenue for reinvestment in sustainable infrastructure and social programs. He also emphasised the importance of supporting small and medium enterprises in this journey. “As we face the urgency of climate change, carbon pricing, coupled with regulation of large companies and support for small and medium enterprises, can galvanise wide-ranging actions across sectors,” said Singh. If the carbon price is high, emitters will be encouraged to collaborate with organisations that have an inclination towards cleaner and low-carbon emitting technologies. As a result, more organisations will start performing emission reduction activities. Verma said that a point may be reached where emitters will find it more economical to explore alternate, less carbon-intensive technologies for their businesses. Such a system can succeed if there are clear regulations. He also said that the Energy Conservation (Amendment) Bill 2022, and the green credit system are some crucial steps taken towards achieving net zero. The Energy Conservation (Amendment) Bill amends the Energy Conservation Act, 2001, to allow the Centre to specify a carbon credit trading scheme, and mandates some designated consumers to meet a fraction of their energy needs from non-fossil fuel sources. All this will help reduce carbon emissions, and hence, mitigate climate change.",business

Chris Evans weighs in on Quentin Tarantino's comment ‘Marvel actors are not stars’,"Hollywood superstar Chris Evans has not worked on any movie set this year. Fans of the Captain America star have been wondering why Evans has been taking fewer acting projects.

Elon Musk's Neuralink is looking for human subjects,"In May, the Elon Musk-owned brain implant company Neuralink announced that it received FDA approval to begin human trials. On Tuesday, the company announced that it received approval from an independent review board that it can begin recruiting human test subjects for its brain implant for patients with paralysis. According to a blog post from the California-based neurotechnology company, the main purpose of these human trials is to test whether its brain-computer interface (BCI)—called the Link—is safe and functional. The aim of Neuralink's BCI and the company as a whole is to create implantable devices that'll let users control things with their brains. And while it sounds super sci-fi, Neuralink is far from the only company developing brain interface devices. ""The initial goal of our BCI is to grant people the ability to control a computer cursor or keyboard using their thoughts alone,"" the company said in its announcement. While this may be an exciting development for some, Neuralink's ""first-in-human clinical trials"" may represent a significant risk for its patients. The company and Musk have come under fire in the past for its treatment of its animal test subjects—so much so that in February 2022, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine filed a complaint alleging Neuralink performed ""invasive and deadly brain experiments."" By December of that same year , the company was under federal investigation for animal welfare violations, with documents alleging the company had killed approximately 1,500 animals since 2018, including pigs, monkeys, mice, and rats. Neuralink fought back against these very serious allegations claiming that the rhesus macaque monkeys under its care were "" respected and honored "" by the team. Musk even went to X (formerly known as Twitter) this past week to say that ""no monkey has died as a result of a Neuralink implant."" That statement directly contradicts the company already admitting to euthanizing several animals after they had developed infections and other side effects, but no one is expecting Musk to be the brightest one in the room. Whether or not Musk is trying to reframe the controversy regarding Neuralink's animal testing doesn't seem to matter at this moment as the company has already gotten the necessary approvals and is gearing up for a very crucial moment in its history. The announcement made it unclear when these trials would begin, but did state that those who have ""quadriplegia due to cervical spinal cord injury or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)"" may qualify for the trial.",technology
Bluesky sees record signups day after Musk says X will go paid-only,"Would you pay to use X, the platform formerly known as Twitter? Apparently, all of these new Bluesky users don't seem so keen to do so. Bluesky , the ""decentralized"" X-alternative social media platform, just had its biggest influx of new users ever on Tuesday. This happened just one day after Elon Musk made headlines during a livestream with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying he plans to charge all of X's users a "" small monthly payment "" to use the platform. As of 2:40pm ET, more than 42,000 new users have joined Bluesky, making Tuesday, September 19, the biggest signup day yet for the currently invite-only platform that launched earlier this year. At publishing time of this article, Bluesky had 1,113,820 users in total. The new user signups are tracked via the third-party website "" Bluesky Stats ."" Looking over Bluesky signup numbers on the tracker for the past month, it appears that the platform usually sees from 10,000 to 20,000 new signups per day. Bluesky has doubled its usual daily new user numbers already, with many more hours left in the day still to go. It's impossible to know whether Musk's comments about charging users to post on X really played a role in this, but it almost certainly had some effect. Bluesky is a direct alternative to the platform formerly known as Twitter. It's backed by Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey. (Although, we should note that Dorsey is not involved in the day-to-day running of Bluesky. The CEO of Bluesky is Jay Graber. Dorsey sits on the board of directors.) In fact, before Musk acquired Twitter, the company now known as X, it even funded Bluesky. It provided $13 million in order to build a new ""decentralized"" version of the platform. Furthermore, Bluesky's previous record-setting signup day was July 3, when 32,325 new users joined the platform. And that occurred amid the July 4th weekend in the U.S., when Musk abruptly made other unpopular changes to Twitter that restricted the content people could see without signing up, a move that alienated casual Twitter users , and benefitted those with paid subscriptions . Rather than paying, it appeared that tens of thousands of users preferred to just get their social media needs met elsewhere. Mashable reached out to Bluesky for comment and will update this post if we hear back. While Musk has previously mentioned his idea of charging all X users to post on the platform, those comments were made late last year, amid all of the other changes he ended up instituting shortly after he acquired it. Clearly, based on the reaction after his recent comments, some were hearing this for the very first time. Whether or not Musk will go through with charging everyone for X is unclear. But for Bluesky, it is pretty clear that Musk simply floating these ideas is good for growth.",technology

Rohit Sharma Looks At Ashwin As A Match-Winner: Saba Karim,"New Delhi, Sep 19 (IANS) Former cricketer Saba Karim weighed in on Ravichandran Ashwin’s return to India’s ODI squad. “I think Rohit Sharma looks at Ravichandran Ashwin as a match-winner and he’s very clear in the kind of approach he wants to portray in white ball cricket. Now with the World Cup coming up, he understands the dynamics of one-day cricket quite well and knows that he has to pick players who have that kind of an attacking mindset,” Karim told JioCinema. “He also knows that in his bowling lineup, he needs to have out of six, at least five wicket-taking options and if he has Ashwin in the eleven, then that attacking option is available. If you look at all the other players who are in the reserve – they all have that attacking mindset. So, I think Rohit Sharma wants to continue with this aggressive approach that we saw the Indian team play in the Asian challenge.” Karim further spoke about Shreyas Iyer's selection in the squad as well. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); “I am glad that they are persisting with Shreyas Iyer. It really shows that the team management and selectors trust him so much. And Shreyas has played a very vital role in the one-day setup. So, I am happy to see that they are backing him right till they announce the World Cup side. “I don’t think there should be any issue with him being part of the side if he's fit, even if he does not score runs in these two or three games – it does not matter. You need to back players who have done well for you in the past and they in any case get three ODI games here plus the two practice matches. The kind of player Shreyas Iyer is – I am pretty excited for him to get back into the fold and score runs at the right time for the Indian side.” (This report has been published as part of the auto-generated syndicate wire feed.

Champions League: Ukrainian fans feel at home and aim to raise awareness of their country in Germany,"For Ukrainians displaced by the Russian invasion, a soccer stadium can feel like a home from home. Unable to play at its actual home because of the war, Ukrainian champion Shakhtar Donetsk is playing its Champions League home games in the German city of Hamburg this season, starting with a 3-1 loss to Porto on Tuesday. Ukrainian supporters said it was a chance to raise awareness of Ukraine and provided a sense of community against the backdrop of the war. “We have a difficult situation but despite that we come and show support because we are very proud of our team,” Valentyna Sushko, who is from the city of Kharkiv in north-eastern Ukraine and has been living in Hamburg since shortly after the invasion last year, told The Associated Press. “I would like to say thank you to Hamburg for giving our team the chance to play in its stadium. A lot of Ukrainian people can come and feel a bit like they are at home.” With some wearing the orange-and-black shirts of Shakhtar, and others wrapped in the blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flag, Ukrainian fans were prominent in the crowd of 46,729 at Hamburg’s Volksparkstadion. Germany has welcomed hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians since the invasion. Locals flocked to the game, too. The usual home team, Hamburger SV, was European champion 40 years ago but is in a prolonged slump and hasn’t hosted European games since the 2009-10 season. Advertisement The crowd cheered a “Thank you, Germany” video message from Shakhtar captain Taras Stepanenko which played before the game on the stadium’s big screens. The pre-game playlist included Ukraine ’s Eurovision Song Contest-winning song “Stefania” from 2022 with its mix of Ukrainian folk and hip-hop influences. For Ukrainian fans, the Champions League is also a way to remind the world about their country and its cause. “I love my Ukraine very much and it hurts, everything that is happening with our country. I came today with my family to support our country and our boys,” said Oresta Rohde, originally from the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, which was hit by a Russian drone attack earlier in the day. “I hope that today the world once again hears Ukraine and helps us, and supports us.” Most Read 1 As Indo-Canadian relations sour, anxiety grips Indian students, residents who wish to settle in Canada 2 Farida Jalal recalls the time when Amitabh Bachchan-Jaya Bachchan were dating: ‘They would pick me up at night, we would go for long drives’ 3 Jawan box office collection day 12: Shah Rukh Khan’s blockbuster nears Rs 900 crore gross worldwide 4 Jawan star Shah Rukh Khan set to become the only Indian actor to have two Rs 1,000-crore grossers in one year 5 Vicky Kaushal on ‘privileged’ Bollywood actors pretending to be middle class: ‘It’s a very tiring process’ See More Advertisement Shakhtar is still playing in the Ukrainian league but no fans are allowed at games there for security reasons.

"India-Canada Diplomatic Row: US Expert Slams Trudeau's Claim Of India's Link To Nijjar Killing, Calls It 'Shameless And Cynical'","India-Canada Diplomatic Row: A US expert has termed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's claim of a ""potential link"" between Indian government agents and the killing of a Khalistani leader a ""shameless and cynical action"" and urged the United States not be part of it. Participating in a panel discussion at the Hudson Institute think-tank, Michael Rubin, Senior Fellow at American Enterprise Institute, claimed Trudeau is playing into the hands of people who are looking at the Khalistani movement as a movement of ego and profit. Canada and India have expelled a senior diplomat each after Trudeau alleged the involvement of ""agents of the Indian government"" in the killing of a prominent Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar, 45, in Surrey in June, claims outrightly rejected by New Delhi as ""absurd"" and ""motivated"". Nijjar, the chief of the banned Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF) and one of India's most-wanted terrorists who carried a cash reward of Rs 10 lakh on his head, was shot dead by two unidentified gunmen outside a gurdwara in Surrey in the western Canadian province of British Columbia on June 18. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); What is striking about Trudeau's ""shameless action and cynical action"" is that while he's making a statement now, the killing of Karima Baluch that was carried out allegedly with Pakistani assistance is a police matter and has not been taken to the Prime Minister's office, Rubin said. ""So, the question then becomes why the discrepancy if not populist political posturing? ... That might help Justin Trudeau in the long term but that's not what leadership is. We really need our politicians on both sides of the aisle here and in Canada, (there is a) need to be much more responsible because they're playing with fire,"" he said. It seems, Rubin said, that some outside hands are trying to revive the Khalistan movement. ""I don't think it will work,"" he said, adding he would not want the US to give legitimacy to this sort of ""cynical manoeuvres by outside powers"". ""It would be a mistake to suddenly see a separatist movement and argue that this is legitimate. And I worry less so with the United States but more so with what we see in Canada right now with Justin Trudeau, that same knee-jerk reaction playing into the hands of people who are looking at the Khalistani movement as a movement for ego, a movement for profit and for politics,"" he said. After Trudeau's remarks in Parliament, Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly confirmed that she has ordered the expulsion of ""a senior Indian diplomat"". Reacting sharply to the allegations and Joly's remarks, India rejected Trudeau's claims, calling them ""absurd and motivated"". The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has also asked a Canadian diplomat to leave India within the next five days. Jassee Singh, founder and chairman of Sikhs of America, said the Khalistani movement does not represent the voice of the majority of Sikhs in the US. ""Sikhs in India are not in favour of Khalistan. Today, Sikhs are in the Indian Army defending the nation, whether it's against China or Pakistan,"" he said. ""There are one million Sikhs living here (in the US) and only a few of them, a very, very small percentage shows up for protests demanding Khalistan,"" he said. Dinsha Mistree, research fellow at the Hoover Institution, said if Canada keeps pushing this narrative, then ""we can see some big challenges there"". He also underlined the importance of intelligence sharing. ""For me, it is just very surprising. Again, the San Francisco consulate is not too far away. I don't think any arrests have been made since this consulate was vandalised twice. If you don't stop these smaller things, (then there is a) danger that they might snowball into bigger things,"" he said. In July, India's consulate in San Francisco came under attack from Khalistan supporters, who tried to set the diplomatic facility on fire, in the second such act of violence within months. A video by Khalistan supporters, dated July 2 posted on X, showed the act of arson at the Indian Consulate. The video, with the words ""violence begets violence"" emblazoned over it, also showed news articles related to the death of Nijjar.

"Asteroid, equivalent to 22 atomic bombs, likely to crash into Earth, but you have nothing to worry - here's why","As approaches the final stages of its seven-year-long OSIRIS-REx mission, the world waits eagerly for the sample of asteroid Bennu to return to Earth. NASA's efforts are a crucial stride towards comprehending and perhaps averting a potentially catastrophic event—a collision of Bennu with Earth. This looming threat led to the deployment of the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft to Bennu in 2016. First identified in 1999, Bennu, a near-Earth asteroid, has been in NASA's sights for quite some time. It's a behemoth about a third of a mile wide, comparable in size to New York's Empire State Building. If it collides with Earth, experts say the impact could unleash energy equivalent to 22 atomic bombs. Also Read: After a significant milestone in October 2020, when OSIRIS-REx successfully collected a sample weighing roughly 250 grams, the largest ever extracted from space, as per Earth.com. This Sunday, the spacecraft will release a mini-fridge-sized capsule, carrying the sample, into Earth's atmosphere. It will speed towards Earth at an astonishing 28,000 mph, withstand temperatures twice that of lava, and eventually parachute into Utah's Great Salt Lake Desert. The importance of this mission is not just about averting disaster. The sample from Bennu will also provide scientists with a glimpse into the processes that led to the formation of our solar system around 4.5 billion years ago. Also Read: Nicola Fox, an associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, stated that the material might potentially shed light on the early solar system's creation and even how life on Earth could have originated, Earth.com reported. The asteroid was named Bennu in 2013 by a nine-year-old North Carolina resident, following his victory in a naming competition. He derived the name from an ancient Egyptian deity. Now, why should you not worry? NASA has calculated the odds of Bennu crashing into Earth to be 1 in 2700, with the most critical time frame being September 24, 2182.",science
World Alzheimer's Day 2023: Does Genetics Play A Role In Alzheimer's? See What Experts Say,"Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type of dementia. It is a progressive disease beginning with mild memory loss and possibly leading to loss of the ability to carry on a conversation and respond to the environment. Alzheimer’s disease involves parts of the brain that control thought, memory, and language. It can seriously affect a person’s ability to carry out daily activities. There are two main types of Alzheimer's: familial and sporadic. Familial Alzheimer's is a rare form that is directly linked to genetic mutations, while sporadic Alzheimer's is more common and has a complex genetic component. Dr Aparna Rajadhyaksha, who is a Senior Consultant - Molecular Genomics and Genetics Expert, at Metropolis Healthcare Limited said, ""The prevalence of dementia in India is 7.4% among adults over the age of 60. That is, about 8.8 million Indians are currently living with dementia. By 2050, over 75% of cases of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are expected to occur in low-and middle-income countries."" ""In most cases, Alzheimer’s does not have a single genetic cause. Instead, it can be influenced by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors. Consequently, a person may carry more than one gene or group of genes that can either increase or reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s. People who develop Alzheimer’s do not always have a history of the disease in their families. Still, those who have a parent or sibling diagnosed with the disease have a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s than those without that association,"" she added. Role Of Genetics In Alzheimer's Disease: Dr Kailas Mirche, who is a Neurologist at Citizens Specialty Hospital, Hyderabad said, ""Genetics plays a significant role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. While it is not solely a genetic disorder, a person's genetic makeup can increase their susceptibility to the disease."" ""Mutations in certain genes, such as APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2, are associated with familial Alzheimer's and can lead to the early onset of the disease, often in a person's 30s to 60s. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene variants, particularly APOE e4, are the most well-established genetic risk factors for sporadic Alzheimer's. Carrying one or two copies of the APOE e4 allele increases the risk and lowers the age of onset,"" he further added. Dr Kailas Mirche continued to say that a genetic predisposition does not guarantee someone will develop Alzheimer's, and conversely, not having these genetic factors does not guarantee immunity. Additionally, environmental factors and lifestyle choices also play a critical role in disease development. The Two Groups Of Alzheimer's Genes: Dr. Shamsheer Dwivedee, who is the Director of Department of Neurology (MIND) at Max Super Specialty Hospital, Dehradun said, ""There are two groups of Alzheimer related genes - 'At risk genes' and 'Deterministic genes'. Dr. Sajid Mairaj, who is a Senior Consultant Physician and Diabetologist at Prayag Hospitals Group went on to talk about these two types of genes: Risk genes, like APOE-e4, increase the chances of developing Alzheimer's but don't guarantee it. APOE-e4 is the most well-known risk gene, and it's estimated that 40-65% of Alzheimer's patients have it. Having one copy of APOE-e4 from either parent raises your risk, and having two copies increases the risk even more. APOE-e4 also tends to bring on symptoms at a younger age. Deterministic genes, on the other hand, directly cause Alzheimer's. If you inherit one of these genes, you will develop the disease. However, these genes are very rare and are responsible for only about 1% or less of Alzheimer's cases. They typically lead to early-onset Alzheimer's, with symptoms starting in a person's 40s to 50s. ""More than 100 genes are identified as 'At risk genes' for Alzheimer’s disease. No point chasing them. One important defining fact about these genes is that though they put the person at risk but the person is unlikely to get the disease before 65 years of age,"" Dr. Shamsheer Dwivedee further said. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); ""A person who wants to reduce the risk of dementia in himself and his loved ones should focus on healthy lifestyle rather than the genetics because 'At risk gene' effect can be negated with these habits which includes, heart healthy diet (works for Alzheimer’s prevention as well), good quality sleep, 4km of brisk walk daily and remaining mentally and socially active,"" he added. He also said that if in a person, Alzheimer’s develops before 60 years of age there are more likelihood of the person carrying the 'definitive' or the dominant gene namely - APP (on chromosome 21), Presenelin 1 (on chromosome 14) and Presenelin 2 (on chromosome 1). If one is carrying these genes then there is a very high chance of getting AD. But these constitutes 0.2 to 0.5 percent of AD in various populations. There is always a family history and the decline in cognitive functions starts early. Why Is It Important To Understand These Genes? ""Understanding these genes is important because it helps us grasp the underlying biology of Alzheimer's, especially the role of a protein called beta-amyloid. It also informs genetic testing, which can identify APOE-e4 and rare deterministic genes. But it's crucial to note that routine genetic testing for Alzheimer's isn't widely recommended. Testing should come with counseling because the results can have profound effects on individuals and their families, including decisions about treatment and how they plan for the future,""said Dr. Sajid Mairaj. One note of caution that before genetic testing a genetic counselling is advisable because partial information can cause unnecessary anxiety, fear and may lead to wrong choices in life. We do not have gene therapy for dementia. The good habits mentioned above is universally true for all types of dementia. So live healthy and stops worrying.

"Social Media Platforms Should Have A Minimum Age Limit Of 21 For Users, Karnataka HC Suggests","The Karnataka High Court proposed on Tuesday that the Central government should contemplate establishing a minimum age requirement for accessing social media, aiming to restrict usage by minors, as reported by PTI. During deliberations on the potential hazards of exposing children to social media, a bench comprising Justices G. Narender and Vijaykumar A. Patil recommended this measure. The Court recommended either implementing a ban on social media or setting a minimum age of 21 for users, highlighting concerns about the addictive nature of these platforms for school-going children and questioning their maturity to discern national interests at the age of 17 or 18 when compared to the voting age of 21. These comments were made during the concluding part of the hearing concerning an appeal by X Corp (previously known as Twitter) related to the Centre's directives to block specific tweets and accounts in 2021 and 2022. The Court is set to announce its decision on the interlocutory applications (IAs) tomorrow. The counsel representing the Central government informed the Court that current legislation mandates users to provide Aadhaar and other documentation to access specific online games. In response, the Court raised the question of why similar measures were not being applied to social media platforms. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-6601185-5""); }); The Court expressed concerns that adjustments might be necessary to ensure that intermediaries like X Corp are protected from potential legal action by account holders, especially when complying with takedown requests while maintaining confidentiality. The bench stressed the need for a clear framework and immunity for such intermediaries based on specific rules and guidelines. Furthermore, the Court highlighted that X Corp should not be expected to make subjective judgments on content removal, emphasising the importance of assessing whether the content in question violates the Information Technology Act, 2000, Section 69A (1) and (2). The Court emphasised that compliance with blocking orders is required only when a violation of these provisions is evident. Meanwhile, X Corp's counsel clarified that the appeal's challenge was limited to the earlier observations made by a single judge regarding the interpretation of laws on post and account blocking. It was stated that X Corp has since complied with the previously contested demands to block posts and accounts. However, concerns were raised regarding the lack of sufficient reasons provided for requesting the takedown of over 1,000 tweets. The Court acknowledged these concerns, particularly related to the justification and reasons behind the Central government's blocking orders, emphasising the need for proper justifications to protect social media intermediaries from potential legal action by users. The case initially began with Twitter challenging certain blocking orders issued by the Indian government, resulting in a single judge of the Karnataka High Court rejecting the challenge and imposing a Rs 50 lakh fine on the social media platform for perceived delays in compliance with block requests. Subsequently, the microblogging platform appealed this decision, and on August 10, a division bench of the High Court stayed the single judge's order, subject to X Corp depositing Rs 25 lakhs to demonstrate its good faith. The matter is scheduled to be revisited tomorrow for the pronouncement of orders on the interlocutory applications.",technology

"US Presidential Election 2024: Joe Biden Trails Behind Donald Trump and Nikki Haley, Leads Vivek Ramaswamy, Shows Poll","Washington, September 20 : Indian-American former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley leads President Joe Biden in hypothetical 2024 head-to-head matchups, according to a new poll. The Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll poll released this week found the US president trailing behind GOP candidates, Donald Trump, Haley and Tim Scott but ahead of Indian-American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. When asked about a hypothetical matchup between Haley and Biden in 2024, 41 per cent of respondents said they would back her, in comparison to 37 per cent who said they would support the current president. Twenty-one per cent of respondents said they didn’t know or were unsure who they would support -- Biden or Haley. “No question that President Joe Biden is showing lagging national poll numbers and that now multiple GOP candidates are ahead of him. This is a new development as (non-Trump) potential opponents like Haley get exposure,” Mark Penn, the co-director of the Harvard CAPS/Harris Poll, told The Hill. The poll shared with The Hill found that 44 per cent of respondents said they would vote for Trump, while 40 per cent said they would back Biden.

When asked about a match between Biden and Scott, the former received 37 per cent, while the latter got 39 per cent in the poll conducted from September 12-14 with 2,103 registered voters. Biden performed better than the other Indian-American in the race, Vivek Ramaswamy, who came in at 37 per cent while Biden received 39 per cent.

‘I want people to fall in love with Gucci again’: Sabato De Sarno shares his plans for the Kering brand,"“My first appointment with fashion was with Gucci.” Sabato De Sarno is sitting on one of four Mario Bellini Le Bambole chairs in his Roman office with his dachshund Luce perched on his lap. It’s been “one month and 10 days” since he took over as creative director of Gucci, the $10 billion Kering brand. The little dog has made herself right at home in Gucci’s 17th-century Palazzo Mancini-Salviati headquarters, but De Sarno, a boyish 40 with a sensitive, thoughtful nature, is still feeling his way around — getting to know the teams, running product tests, and sitting down for introductory interviews like this one. He starts with a personal story about an early fashion purchase. “I took the train to Rome, it was my first time in a luxury store,” he says on the July day we met. “I remember what surprised me was to see the people in the queue outside. I think I felt like my nephew does when I go to Disney with him now. It was emotional. When it was my moment to go in, I bought this jacket, a jacket. Velvet, deep red, with a black collar. I sold the necklace that my parents gave me to buy it. They don’t know that.” Today he has a uniform of black T-shirts, black jeans and white Converse All-Star high-tops, but he still owns that jacket. “Now it’s very small for me,” he says. “I was a young guy, but I still have it because I love it.” A graduate of Milan’s Istituto Secoli, with stints at and before a decade-plus run at Valentino, De Sarno has been in fashion for 20 years, but prior to Gucci he worked behind the scenes and he was comfortable there. “This is a very new moment for me,” he says. “I’m a dreamer, but honestly I’ve never dreamed of something like this.” By the time he bought the , De Sarno knew he wanted to be a fashion designer. “I grew up in a small village in the south called Cicciano close to Naples,” he says. “And I was very interested in what people were wearing in the streets because it’s the first way that you communicate to other people who you are. This is when I started to think about creating clothes, because it’s about helping people to be themselves.” Encouraging his team to be themselves was one of his first tasks at Gucci. “I called everyone into my office, and I said I know I’m your creative director, but I’m Sabato and I was in your position only 20 days ago and I know what you’re thinking, and why you aren’t saying anything. I know you’re scared because a lot of things are changing and you feel part of the old Gucci. But now you are here, and if you are here, you are my team, and I need your opinion.” During our July visit, Sabato De Sarno’s closest allies appear to be Remo Macco, a Gucci veteran who was named the studio director last year, and artistic director Riccardo Zanola, with whom he worked previously at Valentino. De Sarno earned the trust of Pierpaolo Piccioli over a span of 14 years, rising from head of for men and women in 2009 to become his right-hand man. The going-away party Piccioli threw for him at the end of April, with everyone wearing I ? SdS T-shirts, made the rounds on social media. High fashion isn’t accustomed to such public displays of emotion. Of his former boss, De Sarno says, “We’re not similar, but we have a lot of things that we share and we think in the same way. To me this is important: I can’t stay in a place where I don’t feel I can be myself, because I lost a lot of time when I was a teenager not being myself.” He says he didn’t come out as gay until he left home for school in Milan. It was the first place where he “felt free”. When Kering announced his appointment in January, Marco Bizzarri, the company’s then-CEO, said De Sarno was hired to “write Gucci’s next chapter, reinforcing the house’s fashion authority while capitalising on its rich heritage”. The word the designer uses for his take on Gucci is Italianity. Gucci, he says, “It’s a very Italian brand with a huge heritage. Italian in craftsmanship, Italian in taste, and we lost that I think. I want to bring it back. Italianity is part of my story, for sure.” Some designers are artists and some are engineers; De Sarno proudly belongs to the latter category. He chose the Istituto Secoli (then called the Istituto Carlo Secoli) because it offered the most technical training. “The other schools just suggested I draw inspirations for a moodboard. I wanted a school where I could learn skills.” At Prada, an internship led to a full-time job, and he worked in the pattern maker Delia Coccia’s office, turning 2D sketches into . “She was a maker of coats and that’s why my passion today is coats. I collect them because she was the best in Prada.” If eccentric is the adjective Gucci watchers reached for under the brand’s former creative director Alessandro Michele, essential seems better suited to De Sarno’s version. His Gucci debut is likely to open with a coat, in cut and construction and made from a crisp wool, with the house’s trademark striped grosgrain trimming the vent in the back, an unobtrusive but unmissable marque. “I started from the wardrobe, because I felt the urgency to put together the pieces that I like and that I don’t find,” he says. “Yes, there are a lot of coats around the world, but this is my coat, my shape, my fabric, my detail.” The overall of the collection, in keeping with much of what we’ve seen this season in New York and London, is short and leggy. De Sarno’s minis come with built-in shorts that peek below the skirts’ hems. “It creates confidence,” he says. The classic Jackie bag will be making a comeback, but in a softer leather “to make it more everyday”, and the Bamboo bag, too. In a departure from recent status quo, this season’s show will not take place at the Gucci Hub, the sprawling headquarters on the edge of Milan that opened in 2016. Instead, De Sarno has chosen the streets surrounding the Accademia di Brera, a historic fine arts university, where the designer imagines people lining the balconies to watch as the models walk by. Tunes by Mark Ronson, the Gucci show’s official music director whose most recent work includes the soundtrack, might even get them dancing. Art plays a big role in De Sarno’s life. Gallery hopping is one way he and his husband Daniele, who is a lawyer and lives in Brussels, spend their weekends together, but he started collecting before they met, when he was “very young”. He leans towards work with words, work that “makes you think”, as he puts it. The piece behind his desk that reads “Everything is great / Everything is shit / Everything is boring / Everything is alright / Everything is fucked / Everything is sexy / Everything is dull” is by an Chicago artist, Eric Stefanski, and he namechecks Lucio Fontana, “not because of his colours or his sliced canvases, but because of the personal notes he wrote on their backs”. If he were to do like Fontana and put words in the lining of his show-opening coat, what would they be? “I want it. I desire it,” he says. “I want people to fall in love with Gucci again. That’s why I use the word ‘ancora’ for my show.” De Sarno has the Italian word printed in a frame on the wall next to his desk. He also had it tattooed on his left arm after he got the Gucci job (on his right is an Ellsworth Kelly calla lily from when he was 18). “Ancora means a lot of things,” he explains. “It means again, but it’s also more personal; it’s not something you lost, it’s something that you still have, but you want more of it because it makes you happy.” De Sarno made the internet happy when the first image from the campaign was released on 5 August, and Daria Werbowy was its star. Werbowy dominated the runways in the 2000s before walking away from modelling in 2013, but she came back for her old friend Sabato. The pair met 20 years ago, when De Sarno was earning his chops at Prada. “Daria, we started together in this business in 2003, and here you are with me at the beginning of this new adventure,” he wrote on the Instagram post accompanying the ad, in which she wears a bikini bottom with interlocking double Gs at the hip and gold hoop earrings from the company’s high jewellery collection. On his Stories, he posted a two-decades-old snapshot of the two of them together, De Sarno’s curls and Werbowy’s bleached eyebrows serving as markers of the time that has passed. For his runway show this Friday, De Sarno and his casting director Piergiorgio Del Moro are focused on new faces. “I would love to have unknown people,” the designer says. “I want to show an , and if I use famous people you only see them. I’m not sure if they’d help me tell the story I want to tell.” De Sarno understands that Gucci is “a microphone to say things”, and one thing he’s shouting about is young talent. Concurrent with his runway debut, Gucci is sponsoring a gallery show of four young Milan-based artists not far from the Accademia di Brera venue of the show; the exhibition is open to the public and is accompanied by a publication, Gucci Prospettive N.1, Milano Ancora, that De Sarno describes as a “love letter” to Milan. In late July, Kering announced a corporate shakeup. Second-quarter sales at megabrand Gucci had risen 1 per cent to €2.5 billion, below consensus expectations of 4 per cent. However, chairman and CEO François-Henri Pinault, acknowledging the executive changes that had been put in place, said, “the potential of Gucci, in my opinion, is above €15 billion”. Bizzarri was to exit in September, the day after De Sarno’s show, and Jean-François Palus, formerly the Kering Group managing director, would succeed him. The reorganisation could have proved destabilising for a first-time creative director, but when De Sarno hops on the phone a week before his show, he tells a different story. “It was a big change, for sure, but not for me because I’m quite new. I feel like this is a bigger evolution now; all the key people, we are all new.” There’s a lot riding on De Sarno’s shoulders, but he’s ready. “I’m so excited,” he says. “I know the process because it’s part of my work, but the emotion behind this, it’s indescribable.”",entertainment

Siraj Reclaims No. 1 Spot In ICC ODI Rankings After Asia Cup Final Heroics,"Indian speedster Mohammed Siraj on Wednesday climbed eight places to reclaim the number one spot in the ODI bowler's rankings ahead of the ICC World Cup which begins on October 5. Siraj's onslaught in the Asia Cup final bundled out Sri Lanka on 50 and helped him top the bowling rankings chart. With the Asia Cup-winning spell of 6/21, Siraj has got back No 1 position which he lost in March this year to Josh Hazlewood. Siraj finished the tournament with 10 wickets at an average of 12.2. He has overtaken bowlers like Trent Boult, Rashid Khan and Mitchell Starc in the rankings. The Afghan spin duo of Mujeeb Ur Rahman and Rashid Khan also improved their rankings to No. 4 and No. 5 respectively. They were the only others to go up in the top 10. Outside that space, South Africa's Keshav Maharaj showed a tremendous rise after returning from his injury. Maharaj helped the Proteas become just the fifth side to win a five-match ODI series after losing the first two games against the 'Baggy Greens'. The left-arm spinner's 4-33 in the fifth ODI gave him eight wickets in the series at an average of 16.87 and an economy of just 4.07 per over. He is currently at 15th, up ten places from his previous career-high. Changes were also seen in the ICC Men's ODI Batting Rankings.

"'Yuvraj, Dhoni,...': Australia Legend Advices India To 'Tap' These Greats","A Cricket World Cup in India - it's a dream come true for a nation that loves to idolise its cricketers. The last time India hosted the ODI World Cup, MS Dhoni 's men brought cheers to billions by winning the marquee event. This time, Rohit Sharma and Co. are carrying the hopes of the country. India have not won any ICC event since 2013 and the World Cup at home is a brilliant opportunity to end that drought. Playing at home brings with it great pressure. Former Australia wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist , himself a World Cup winner, had a piece of special advice for the Indian cricket team. To a question by Sportstar , which read, ""What will your advice be for the youngsters like Gill and Ishan Kishan , who will be playing their first ODI World Cup at home?"" Gilchrist said: ""I can't claim to know what it is like to be an Indian player, playing in India (laughs). It's always intriguing. If I would be in the Indian hierarchy, I would be tapping into guys like Sachin (Tendulkar), MS (Dhoni) to come in and spend time with the group if they are available, and pass on all their experience,"" he said. ""I would have tried to get guys like Yuvraj (Singh), who had so much going on his life during that 2011 tournament, and ask them to speak openly about it. ""Virat, obviously, was part of that team without being a feature member of the team at that time. I would be drawing on that experience of playing a home World Cup and try to find out how they did it. If you can keep that external noise quiet, it allows you to play your best cricket."" India's final assignment before the World Cup at home will be a three ODI series against Australia from September 22 onwards. After this, they will play WC warm-up games against England (September 30) and the Netherlands (October 3). India will then start its World Cup campaign on October 8 against the Aussies at Chennai. In a conversation on JioCinema's 'Home of the Blues', former India wicketkeeper Saba Karim weighed in on Ravichandran Ashwin 's return to India's ODI squad. ""I think Rohit Sharma looks at Ravichandran Ashwin as a match-winner and he is very clear in the kind of approach he wants to portray in white ball cricket. Now with the World Cup coming up, he understands the dynamics of one-day cricket quite well and knows that he has to pick players who have that kind of an attacking mindset. ""He also knows that in his bowling lineup, he needs to have out of six, at least five wicket-taking options and if he has Ashwin in the eleven, then that attacking option is available. If you look at all the other players who are in the reserve – they all have that attacking mindset. So, I think Rohit Sharma wants to continue with this aggressive approach that we saw the Indian team play in the Asian challenge."" Ashwin had last played an ODI last year in January against South Africa. Even then, he had returned to ODIs after June 2017. With ANI inputs",sports

Rana is now working with the multiple-time World Cup gold medallist to help her bag a 2024 Paris Olympic quota place and win medals at the Asian Games in Hangzhou. But the National Rifle Association of India's (NRAI) policy of not allowing personal coaches to accompany shooters at international competitions is something which has been a sore point with several marksmen for long. ""I'm hoping that this situation gets sorted soon. I've put in a request that he (Rana) accompany me for major competitions, like the quota competitions or the World Championships and all these...major events at least,"" Manu told PTI on the sidelines of a sendoff function organised for the Asian Games-bound shooting team. The Hangzhou Asian Games are scheduled to commence on September 23. Manu, who missed Rana during the World Championships in Baku recently, however, hoped the issue will be resolved soon. ""Most likely it will be sorted. I think Kalikesh (Singdeo, NRAI president) is really supportive of me and he's been helping me out and in certain situations. ""Even the team coaches are very coordinating (co-operative) but, I believe, my best performance lies with my (personal) coach only, which is why we have reunited,"" added Manu, the winner of nine World Cup gold medals in individual and team events. Asked about the key areas Rana was working on to improve her performance, Manu said the multiple-time Asian Games gold medallist's ability to ""distract me in a positive way"" was something no other coach could do. ""He (Rana) just knows how to work with me. He's been working with me since I was a child and he just knows the tricks and the things how to distract me in a positive way, like take my mind off things which are bothering me. So, I think he knows the secret (to make me a better shooter). Advertisement ""Anything that takes my mind off my technique, I always discuss it with him. Anything, like the exams coming up or maybe I've had a fight with somebody, so it's like I talk to him about everything. ""He easily calms me down or just gives me a solution or tells me what to do, what is the right thing to do,"" added Manu, who will be competing in the 25m sports pistol event at the Asian Games. Manu had competed in three pistol events during the 2018 Jakarta Asian Games but couldn't win a medal. The Haryana shooter said she will try to give her best performance at Hangzhou. ""The expectations from the Asian Games will always remain the same. I'll try to give the best performance as per my ability, and the best I can do for the Indian shooting team and the Indian contingent . So, the aim would be the same -- to be in the best form and to be able to give my best. Manu added that she would continue to train and compete in both the 10m and 25m pistol events and give equal importance to both, even though she would be competing in the 25m pistol event at the Asian Games. ""As much as I love my other events (10m air pistol), I love 25m as well...I would like to shoot in 10m also I would give my best in 25m as well,"" she added. The champion shooter is hopeful of clinching a Paris Olympic quota place during the Asian Championships in Changwon, South Korea, which will take place after the Asian Games. ""I feel it (Asian Championships) will be a bright competition and the entire shooting team, including me, we are all geared up and very much looking forward to the event for quota places."" Does the pistol malfunction during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, which probably cost her a place in the 10m air pistol final even come back to haunt her? Manu indicated it was one of those days when it just happened, adding that she has ""full trust"" in her equipment. ""I think, whenever you are competing you need to have full trust in your equipment and your ability. ""If you have the slightest of trust issues, I don't think you are ready to shoot in the competition, so you have to have full faith and full trust in every possible thing, your equipment, yourself, your coach and the entire team."" The champion shooter feels the learnings from being a top-notch athlete will help her when she is done with the sport. ""I'm done with my Bachelors in political science. Now, I am pursuing public administration from Punjab University, so have all political subjects like international relations, indian administration and stuff like that. ""The experience that I get travelling, socialising with different people, different backgrounds, different countries, cultures... that definitely counts. I believe you should have something side by side (to fall back upon). ""If you put so much attention on one specific thing, it will probably mess your head up. So, having two things is a bliss for me and I enjoy it."" (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",sports
Asian Games: One Last Hurrah For Many Indian Athletes,"Several of India's achievers and consistent performers, including tennis ace Rohan Bopanna, hockey great P R Sreejesh and TT legend Sharath Kamal, are gearing up for one last hurrah at the Asian Games. Both Sharath and Rohan are still pulling off world class performances in their 40s while 35-year-old Sreejesh remains the proverbial wall of the Indian hockey team. The other big names who are expected to say goodbye to the continental event include wrestling veteran Bajrang Punia, squash star Dipika Pallikal, tennis player Ankita Raina and discus thrower Seema Punia. All of them might be in the twilight of their careers but remain medal contenders at the Games. PTI analyses their chances ahead of the quadrennial event, which was delayed by one year due to COVID-19. Rohan Bopanna The 43-year-old tennis veteran is turning the clock back with his exploits on the men's doubles circuit this year. Having made the semifinals and final of Wimbledon and US Open respectively this season, the big serving Indian is showing age is just a number. Only yesterday, he made a bid adieu to the Davis Cup on a winning note and would be expected to do the same in the men's doubles event in China. Bopanna, who made his Asian Games debut way back in 2002, goes into the tournament as the defending champion, having won the doubles gold alongside Divij Sharan in the 2018 edition. He could partner Yuki Bhambri in Hangzhou. Sharath Kamal The 41-year-old table tennis ace will look to add to his surprise two Asian Games medals in his fifth and final appearance. Last year, he was among the stand out players in the Commonwealth Games, where he won as many as three gold medals. Advertisement The lead up to the Asian Games has not been the smoothest for him but one can expect him to raise his game when the stakes are high. The men's team bronze in the last edition had ended a 60-year wait for a table tennis medal at the Asian Games and that event remains India's best bet. Competition in Asian Games is much higher than the CWG and the trio of Sharath, G Sathiyan and Harmeet Desai would be aiming to match its recent performance at the Asian Championships where it earned a bronze. Sharath had picked up an unexpected bronze with Manika Batra in the previous edition in Jakarta but the female star will be be paring with up Sathiyan on this occasion. Ankita Raina ======== She will be another medal contender on the tennis court. The 30-year-old became only the second Indian female tennis player after Sania Mirza to win a singles medal at the Asian Games when she secured a bronze in the 2018 edition. Besides a bagful of doubles medals, Sania managed to win a singles silver and bronze in Asian Games. Raina is also likely to feature in the women's doubles and mixed doubles event. P R Sreejesh By his own admission, the veteran goalkeeper is taking one tournament at a time at the fag end of his career. The upcoming Asian Games is definitely Sreejesh's last shot at the continental showpiece and he will be giving his all to help India claim the gold and qualify directly for next year's Paris Olympics. He has registered 301 international caps so far after making his India debut in 2006. He played a major part in India winning an Olympic medal after four decades and his form will be crucial if the team is to regain the gold after settling for a disappointing bronze in Jakarta five years ago. Sreejesh will continue to share goalkeeping duties with the much younger Krishan Bahadur Pathak. Dipika Pallikal The mother of two is certainly competing in her fourth and last Asian Games. The 32-year-old, who has two singles and as many team medals to her name at Asian Games, will only be seen in the mixed doubles event alongside Harinderpal Sandhu. The former world number 10 and Sandhu had an ideal build up to the Games by winning the test event in Hangzhou in June. Following the birth of her twins, Dipika had won two world doubles title alongside Joshna Chinappa and Saurav Ghosal (mixed) last year. She followed it up with a mixed doubles bronze in the Commonwealth Games and is determined to end her Asian Games career with another medal. Bajrang Punia The 29-year-old champion wrestler will be making his first appearance on the mat after leading the protest against former WFI president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh for alleged sexual harassment of female wrestlers. All eyes will be on the seasoned pro who will take the mat to defend his 65kg title in China. The Tokyo Olympics bronze medallist will be making his third appearance at the Asian Games. Before the gold in Jakarta, he had secured silver in the 2014 edition. Seema Punia The 40-year-old discus thrower has managed to win a gold and bronze in the previous two editions. The CWG in Birmingham last year was a disappointment as she failed to win a medal after doing so in the past four editions. Asian Games will be her last chance to end on the podium.

"Food Items To Include In Diet For Healthy Skin, Hair And Nails","In today's world, it's evident that we often indulge our taste buds without considering the nutritional value of what we're consuming. The truth is, our food choices play a vital role in shaping our health, especially when it comes to common issues like skin problems, hair troubles, and digestive disorders. Food Items For Healthy Skin, Hair And Nails As We Age Dr. Manoj Kutteri,who is the Medical Director and CEO, at Atmantan Wellness Centre shared t he following food components and nutrients can improve skin, hair and nail health: Nuts and seeds: Nuts and seeds like almonds, walnuts, flaxseeds, and chia seeds are full of vitamins, minerals and various antioxidants that promote skin suppleness, strong hair, and strong nails. These little nutritional powerhouses can have a big impact on the health and strength of your hair and nails since they are loaded with vital nutrients. For instance, almonds are a good source of biotin and vitamin E, which help to develop hair and keep nails from becoming brittle. Omega-3 fatty acids found in walnuts nourish your hair follicles, give your hair shine, and support the growth of strong, robust nails. Omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and protein are found in abundance in flaxseeds and chia seeds. These nutrients not only boost hair development but also fight nail breakage and improve nail health. Avocado: When it comes to promoting healthy hair and nails, avocados are a great addition to your diet. The huge amount of beneficial monounsaturated fats in avocados not only hydrates your skin but also feeds your hair and nails from the inside, keeping them from breaking or becoming dry. Additionally, avocados are a fantastic source of vitamin E, which promotes the health and radiance of your hair as well as maintaining the integrity of your skin. Avocados contain biotin, which encourages hair development and fortifies your nails to prevent breakage. A tasty and organic method to improve the general health and appearance of your hair and nails is by including avocados in your diet. Eggs: Eggs are a rich source of biotin, a B vitamin crucial for healthy hair and nails. Additionally, they offer protein, which is crucial for hair development. The B vitamin biotin, which is abundant in them, is necessary for preserving the health and expansion of your hair and nails. They are also a fantastic source of protein, offering the amino acids required for constructing the structural elements of both hair and nails. Egg protein stimulates the growth of keratin, the protein that makes up your hair and nails, making them stronger and less prone to breakage. It also aids in the restoration of damaged hair. Spinach: This lush vegetable is a great provider of a number of essential elements that support their health and vigour. Iron, which is important for promoting healthy hair growth and reducing hair loss, is abundant in spinach. Iron supports healthy hair by assisting red blood cells in transporting oxygen to the hair follicles. Additionally, spinach contains vitamins A and C, which are essential for preserving the health and aesthetics of your skin, hair, and nails. Vitamin C encourages the formation of collagen, improving skin suppleness and promoting strong, healthy nails, while vitamin A aids skin regeneration. A delicious and healthy method to strengthen your hair and nails and make them feel and look their best is to include spinach in your diet. Water: Maintaining good skin, hair, and nails depends on staying hydrated. Water flushes impurities from the body and aids in the delivery of nutrients to certain regions. Transporting vital nutrients to cells throughout your body, including those responsible for hair and nail growth, is one of water's main functions. Your hair follicles obtain the essential nutrients they need to thrive when you're properly hydrated. Maintaining your skin's natural moisture levels with enough hydration also improves your nails indirectly by benefiting your skin. While well-moisturized skin maintains the strength and flexibility of your nails, dry, dehydrated skin can cause brittle nails. Fatty Fish: Omega-3 fatty acids, which are abundant in fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and sardines, aid to retain skin moisture, reduce inflammation, and support healthy hair and nails. The health and look of your hair and nails can be greatly enhanced by eating fatty seafood like salmon, mackerel, and sardines. Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, which have a wealth of advantages, are abundant in this fish. Essential fatty acids called omega-3s help to retain the hydration and suppleness of skin while lowering inflammation, which can cause skin issues. Omega-3 fatty acids feed hair follicles, encourage hair development, and add gloss and luster to your hair. Additionally, they support healthy scalp maintenance by minimizing flakiness and dandruff, which can harm hair growth. Green tea: Green tea is a powerhouse of antioxidants that can shield your skin from harm and help keep it looking young. Numerous bioactive substances found in this tea, which is high in antioxidants, may help to improve their strength and look. First off, polyphenols, especially epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant characteristics, are abundant in green tea. These substances aid in defending your skin against oxidative stress and environmental elements that can cause premature aging and brittle nails. Berries: Berries like blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries are abundant in antioxidants, work to protect your skin from the destructive effects of free radicals, which can hasten the aging process and weaken hair and nails. Berry antioxidants, especially vitamin C, encourage the creation of collagen, which is necessary for preserving skin elasticity and suppleness. Additionally, berries include nutrients like biotin, folate, and vitamin E that support healthy, shiny hair and strong nails. Sweet Potatoes: A nutritious powerhouse, sweet potatoes are a great source of beta-carotene, a vitamin A precursor that is vital for healthy skin. Sweet potatoes can help you avoid problems like dry, flaky skin and brittle nails because a vitamin A deficiency can cause them. Additionally, sweet potatoes have a plethora of vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, which helps to produce collagen and improve the elasticity and suppleness of skin. Additionally, sweet potatoes' high biotin content promotes nail growth and hair growth while lowering the chance of breakage. Lean Proteins: Protein is found in lean meats like chicken and turkey and is necessary for the growth and repair of tissues, including the hair and nails. These proteins are abundant in the essential amino acids that serve as keratin, the protein that gives your hair and nails their strength. By including lean protein in your diet, you can be sure to give your body the building blocks it needs for strong, lustrous hair and nails. Citrus Fruits: Citrus fruits like oranges, lemons, and grapefruit are rich in vitamin C, which is important for the creation of collagen, crucial for skin suppleness. When it comes to promoting the health and beauty of your hair and nails, citrus fruits like oranges, lemons, and grapefruits are zesty treasures. Collagen, an essential protein for the flexibility and firmness of skin, is produced in large part thanks to vitamin C. Citrus fruits' high vitamin C content aids in reversing this process, leaving your skin glowing and young-looking. When it comes to your hair, vitamin C helps with the synthesis of collagen and keratin, two things required for healthy, strong hair. Additionally, it facilitates the uptake of iron from plant-based sources, ensuring that your hair follicles get the minerals they need for healthy growth. Additionally, Ruchika Rajbans, who is the Founder of Arechar Nutra, suggested some food items that not only boosts your inner health but also fulfills your daily nutritional requirements, paving the way for healthier skin, luscious hair, and stronger nails. Berries are more than just a delightful treat; they're packed with antioxidants that shield your body from free radicals and promote collagen production, giving you an age-defying glow. Marine food sources, rich in Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids, work wonders for your skin's moisture and hair's strength, all while offering a plethora of essential nutrients. Avocados, nuts, and soybeans are other nutritional powerhouses that improve skin and hair health, ensuring you shine from the inside out. Sea buckthorn, with its incredible array of antioxidants and nutrients, which not only brighten your skin but also protect it from UV damage and promote healing.

Ae Dil Hai Mushkil Was Inspired By Karan Johar's One-Sided Love; Director Reveals 'He Is Part Of My Family Today',"The 2016 film starring Ranbir Kapoor, Anushka Sharma and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan evoked many feelings in their viewers.

""It is not known how many others are on the list, but hopefully, the chief of ISRO, under whom India landed on the moon, will be one. Obviously, it can't be given to everybody who has played for India, but if the associations where the matches are being played are instructed to invite the Indian players from their city to the games in that city, it would be a magnificent gesture. Of course, two others who deserve the golden ticket are the two World Cup-winning captains, Kapil Dev and Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Neeraj Chopra, the Olympic and World Athletics Championship gold medallist, is another one who comes to mind for the BCCI golden ticket.""",sports

"""Don't Think Kohli Wants Power. He Just..."": Ex-India Star's Blunt Remark","Star batter Virat Kohli in undoubtedly one of the greatest sportspersons in the history of cricket. From being a world-class batter to one of the fittest fielders, Kohli has ticked all the boxes. The 'Run Machine' Kohli is also inching closer to surpass India legend Sachin Tendulkar in the list of most ODI hundreds scored by a batter. Tendulkar had registered 49 ODI centuries in his phenomenal 24-year-old long career and Kohli is just three tons behind from dethroning him. The 34-year-old batter smashed his 47th ton during the Asia Cup Super 4 match against Pakistan. Apart from their fiery batting performances, former India batter Sanjay Manjrekar that picked up certain similarities between Kohli and Tendulkar. ""The one similarity between Virat Kohli and Sachin Tendulkar is that both of them enjoy playing cricket. They want to be on the field. He was not part of the team for the game against Bangladesh but was still on the field. I don't think Virat Kohli wants power or leadership,"" Manjrekar told journalist Vimal Kumar. ""He just wants to play and it looks like he enjoys being a part of the team. He captained the team for a very long time, so there is no scope for an unfulfilled dream. Being with the team, travelling with players, going to the ground, and being part of winning moments are more important to him than having power,"" he added. Manjrekar further stated that it would be difficult for Kohli to surpass the 'Master Blaster' in the list of most Test centuries as Tendulkar has got 51 while the Royal Challengers Bangalore star is still at 29. ""Sachin Tendulkar has 51 hundreds, 17 more than what Sunil Gavaskar finished with. For a good player, accumulating runs in ODIs is comparatively easy, as bowlers don't always try to take a wicket. Tendulkar and Kohli are special because they also have a lot of Test hundreds. However, I believe it will be very difficult for Kohli to reach 51 Test centuries,"" said Manjrekar. Talking about Team India, the Rohit Sharma -led side defeated Sri Lanka by 10 wickets and clinched their eighth Asia Cup title on Sunday in Colombo. Team India will now take on Australia in the upcoming three-match ODI series, which will kick-start on Friday. This series is the final dress rehearsal for hosts India before the 2023 Cricket World Cup, starting on October 5.",sports

England will be coming to this side after clinching a three-match ODI series 3-1 against New Zealand. On the other hand, Ireland will also be putting their best foot forward in order to clinch victory. ( Live Scorecard ) UPDATE - UPDATE - 6.19 pm IST (12.49 pm GMT) - The rain has eased down a bit but the covers are still on. However, some of the groundstaff have started to mop up. We hope that it stays like this and the action starts sooner than expected. Stick with us for more news. UPDATE - 5:33 pm IST (12:03 pm GMT) - It is still pouring down and there is not much improvement. The cut-off time for a 20-over game to be played is 10:02 pm IST (4:32 pm GMT) hopefully, we will get to see some overs of cricket being played. Stay put as we bring you further updates. UPDATE - 5.06 pm IST (11.36 am GMT) - There is nothing new from the middle as the covers are still firmly on and instead of cricket we are playing the waiting game. UPDATE: 4:35 pm IST (11:05 am GMT) - As expected, the rain has been consistent and the covers are still on. The toss is delayed due to rain. Stay tuned for further updates. Ireland have not played this format since July this year. They will be playing an ODI after a long break away from home. They have had a good qualifying round for the World Cup. The Irish have won their last 3 ODI's. They will look to continue their streak and defeat their opposition at their home turf. Stay put as live action will be taking center stage shortly. We will be getting you the toss and team news shortly. England are in super form after dominating a series against New Zealand at home. They won that series 3-1. They will also have the home advantage in this series, and it will be good practice for the squad ahead of the World Cup. The Englishmen will hope that they gain much necessary momentum with another series victory ahead of the World Cup. Hello and a very warm welcome folks. We are awaiting an exciting clash between England and Ireland. The venue for the first game is Headingley Carnegie in Leeds. There is some prediction of rain so let's hope there is not much interruption in the play. ... MATCH DAY ... The 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup is just around the corner and in the lead-up to the mega event, England face Ireland in a three-match ODI series, the first of which will be played at Headingley in Leeds. The English cricketing summer has seen plenty of action both domestically and internationally and New Zealand were the latest team to finish their white-ball tour just a few days back after losing 3-1 to the hosts in the ODI series. England, as expected have made a lot of changes to the side for this particular series against Ireland and almost all of the first-team members have been rested keeping the World Cup in mind. Joe Root though will be a part of the squad and will be hoping to get some runs under his belt and it will be Zak Crawley who will lead the team. Crawley had an excellent Ashes just a couple of months back but has only featured in three ODIs for the senior national side, and all of them came against Pakistan during the height of Covid-19. Rehan Ahmed and Luke Wood are two other members that will look to make a mark and with an explosive batting trio of Philip Salt, Ben Duckett and Sam Hain also in the mix, this is by no means a slouch team. There as as many as three uncapped players in the squad and all three of them will most certainly get at least one chance over the course of these three matches. Moving on to Ireland now and they have their usual full-strength team which always possesses a threat and it will be Paul Stirling leading the team. Stirling along with former captain Andy Balbirnie will have a big job up top with the bat and both have been in decent ODI form off late. The likes of Harry Tector and Lorcan Tucker will hope to start getting more consistent but even if they don't, Curtis Campher in that middle order will play a big role for the visitors. Joshua Little and Mark Adair are both excellent new ball bowlers and both will hope to use the English conditions to their benefit. A series that might not seem like an important one given the World Cup in sight and the team England are playing but it is still a pretty big deal. England can assess this series in order to fill places in the team that might open up after the World Cup and keep the transition smooth. On the other hand, Ireland will only become better by playing against a quality opposition. Talking about the playing conditions, it will be overcast at Headingley with a few chances of rain as well. The pitch is good for batting but if the pacers hit their strides, they can have a field day as well. So, will a young England side filled with quality individuals rise up to the challenge? Or will an experienced Irish side be able to take the lead? We shall find out.",sports
ICC Confirms Venues In United States For T20 World Cup 2024. They Are...,"The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Wednesday confirmed New York, Dallas and Florida as the three venues for the USA-leg of the ICC Men's World Cup 2024. Broward County (Florida), Grand Prairie (Dallas) and Eisenhower Park (New York) will be the three stadiums hosting the matches in the US. This is the first time the tournament will be played in the USA, and they will co-host it with the West Indies. The ICC had awarded the event to the USA in 2021. Geoff Allardice, the Chief Executive of the governing body, said, these venues have been zeroed in after an extensive evaluation process. ""We're delighted to announce the three USA venues that will host part of the biggest ICC Men's T20 World Cup ever staged, with 20 teams competing for the trophy. ""We explored a number of potential venue options in the country, and we were hugely encouraged by the enthusiasm the event generated amongst prospective hosts,"" said Allardice in an ICC release. Allardice said the existing venues at Florida and Dallas will be expanded to accommodate more fans, media and premium hospitality areas using the modular stadium solutions. He said the same technology will be used to build a 34,000-seat modular stadium at Nassau County, New York, and he hoped to acquire the required permit from local officials by next month. ""We are very excited about the opportunity to use modular stadium technology. This technology has been used at previous ICC events to increase venue capacity and it's routinely used in other major sports around the world. ""In the USA, it will give us the opportunity to increase the size of the venues in both Dallas and Florida and create what is going to be a stunning venue in New York,"" said Allardice. A number of other venues around the USA, including George Mason University in Washington, the new home of MLC team Washington Freedom, have also been identified as potential venues for pre-event matches and training. The ICC's announcement has also allayed all concerns over USA hosting the T20 WC 2024 because of the doubts surrounding the readiness of the stadiums. Advertisement",sports
